# All-rate Reed-Solomon capacity formalization

Status: active planning and integration tracker  
Last updated: 2026-09-04  
Integration branch: `quang/all-rate-rs-capacity-formalization`  
Fork: <https://github.com/quangvdao/ArkLib>  
ArkLib base: `Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib@22dbd4e836c15a21f68889afa69b7130da04abbb`

This document is the single source of truth for formalizing the all-rate hidden-derivative Reed-Solomon list-decoding theorem. It is deliberately kept on the integration branch with the proof. It records the theorem contract, provenance, dependencies, ownership boundaries, risks, and completion gates for a long-running multi-contributor effort.

The fork and this branch are public because GitHub forks of the public ArkLib repository are public. No result should be described as verified or announced from this branch until the gold completion gate below passes.

## 1. Mission and non-negotiable scope

The target is an axiom-clean Lean proof that hidden-derivative interpolation list decodes Reed-Solomon codes at every rate up to every fixed positive gap from capacity. The derivative order must depend only on the gap, not on the rate, block length, evaluation set, or received word.

The project may first prove weaker constants or a worse list-size exponent. It may not weaken any of the following qualitative conclusions:

- all code rates are covered;
- every fixed capacity gap `δ > 0` is covered;
- one derivative order `d(δ)` works uniformly over all rates;
- the evaluation points are arbitrary and distinct;
- the main theorem applies over prime fields with `q ≥ n`;
- the output list is characterized exactly, rather than merely soundly;
- the list bound has the form `C(δ) q^e(δ)`, with exponent and prefactor independent of `n` once `δ` is fixed;
- the proof exposes the characteristic hypotheses used by differential root finding.

The initial capstone may use an existential or very large explicit `d(δ)` and the older `q^(4d+6)`-type bound. The optimized derivative order, the `q^(2d)` bound, the `d = 0` and `d = 1` regimes, and shrinking-gap results are refinement milestones, not excuses to delay the qualitative all-rate theorem.

## 2. Target theorem contracts

The exact Lean signatures will be frozen in task `S0`. The following mathematical statements are normative.

### 2.1 Combinatorial capstone

For every real `δ` with `0 < δ < 1`, there exist natural numbers `d = d(δ)`, `N = N(δ)`, and a list-bound exponent or constant depending only on `δ` such that the following holds.

For every `n ≥ N`, every `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, every prime `q ≥ n`, every injection

```text
α : Fin n ↪ ZMod q,
```

and every received word `y : Fin n → ZMod q`, define

```text
A = k + ceil(δ n).
```

If `A > n`, the requested list is empty. Otherwise, the set of polynomials `P` with `degree P < k` and at least `A` agreements with `y` has cardinality bounded by a function of `q` and `δ` that is independent of `n`, `k`, `α`, and `y`. The first accepted form may use `q^(4d+6)` or another rigorously derived constant exponent. The refined form should prove `O_δ(q^(2d))`, improving to `O_δ(q^d)` under the paper's larger-field condition.

The theorem must also be connected to ArkLib's canonical `ReedSolomon.code`, `Code.agree`, `Code.closeCodewordsRel`, and `Code.Lambda` definitions. A corollary should state the corresponding radius `1 - k/n - δ`, with all floor and ceiling conversions proved rather than left implicit.

### 2.2 Algorithmic capstone

There is a decoder that returns exactly the degree-`< k` polynomials meeting the agreement threshold. Soundness, completeness, duplicate-freedom or set semantics, and the list-size bound must be proved.

The first combinatorial capstone need not claim runtime. A runtime theorem is accepted only after its algorithm and cost model are represented faithfully in Lean. Informal extraction from noncomputable existence is not an algorithmic theorem.

### 2.3 Uniformity test

The final quantifier order must make rate independence syntactically visible:

```text
∀ δ, 0 < δ → δ < 1 →
  ∃ d N B, ∀ n k q α y, ...
```

In particular, `d` must be chosen before `n`, `k`, the rate, `q`, `α`, and `y`. Any theorem with `d` chosen after `k/n` is not the target theorem.

### 2.4 Characteristic boundary

The local Hasse-Taylor identities are characteristic-safe. The nonsingular-jet lifting argument is not. Its hypotheses must explicitly imply:

- the ambient polynomial degree `D` is less than the characteristic;
- every relevant individual `Y_j`-degree is less than the characteristic;
- the chosen base or extension field has enough points to find a nonsingular witness.

For the prime-field capstone, these obligations must be discharged from `q ≥ n`, the ambient choice, and the eventual block-length threshold. A cardinality-only finite-field generalization must not silently conceal bounded-characteristic failure.

The preferred generic root-counting contract is division-free. If `S` is the witness-field size, `H` bounds the bad witness points, `Δ` bounds the relevant individual degree, and `Roots_D(Q)` is the set of degree-`≤D` solutions, prove a natural-number inequality of the form

```text
(S - H) * card (Roots_D Q) ≤ S * Δ * S^d.
```

The `q^(2d)` and larger-field `q^d` bounds should be corollaries. This avoids field division and keeps the exact finite hypotheses visible.

### 2.5 Strong quantitative capstone

After the qualitative capstone is axiom-clean, the target derivative order from the current paper snapshot is

```text
dδ = 0                              if δ ≥ 1/2,
dδ = 1                              if 1/4 ≤ δ < 1/2,
dδ = ceil(exp((172/25) / δ))        if 0 < δ < 1/4.
```

The rational constant `172/25` is the exact formal representation of `6.88`. Decimal approximation must not enter a proof term. This phase also targets the larger-field `q^d` list bound and the shrinking-gap corollary `δ_n = C / log n` for `C > 13.76`, subject to re-audit whenever the paper source commit changes.

## 3. Gold trust and announcement gate

The project is complete only when all of the following hold on the integration branch:

- the combinatorial capstone has no project axioms and no `sorry`, `admit`, `unsafe`, or native-code trust escape;
- the differential root-counting theorem used by the capstone is proved in ArkLib, not imported as an axiom;
- the algorithmic capstone, if announced, has a proved exact decoder and an honest cost model;
- `#print axioms` for every advertised capstone reports only ArkLib's accepted logical baseline, normally `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`;
- `./scripts/validate.sh --axioms` passes;
- the theorem statement has undergone an independent adversarial audit against the paper and against edge cases;
- a clean clone of the fork branch builds and reproduces the axiom audit;
- every adapted source is credited at file level and in the blueprint bibliography.

A theorem temporarily parameterized by the Kopparty root-finding result may be useful as scaffolding, but it is not a completed verification and must be named and documented as conditional. It must not be the theorem used for an announcement.

## 4. Sources, provenance, and credit

### 4.1 Mathematical sources

- Joshua Brakensiek, Yeyuan Chen, Aaron Putterman, Zihan Zhang, and Kai Zhe Zheng, *Algorithmic List Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes up to Capacity in the Low-Rate Regime*, ECCC TR26-164. This is the source of the hidden-derivative interpolation framework and the published low-rate specialization.
- Swastik Kopparty's differential-equation root-finding theorem, as cited by the ECCC report. This result must be reconstructed in Lean for the gold capstone.
- The all-rate strengthening paper by Quang Dao and Justin Thaler, source snapshot `81c12b07307e8bf49f61cdbf18736d6b8777f539` in the research repository. This is the normative source for the stronger theorem, uniform ambient-padding argument, improved interpolation analysis, sharper list bound, refinements, and limitations.

Exact bibliographic entries and theorem-to-source links must be added to `blueprint/src/references.bib` as modules land.

### 4.2 Prior Lean formalization

Kai Zhe Zheng's repository <https://github.com/kz99/rs-ld-mca>, pinned at commit `82c1d5c00820f74a7ec18be716c033430bef5ae8`, is an approved source of formalization material. Its substantive formalization commit is `be57cd2`. Adapted material must credit Kai Zhe Zheng, preserve the source commit, and state that it is used with permission. The durable project-owner attestation, exact source revisions, current adaptation map, and unresolved evidence fields are recorded in [`docs/kb/sources/rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md`](docs/kb/sources/rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md).

The pinned repository currently:

- builds with warnings treated as errors;
- passes `lean --trust=0` on its main module;
- contains no `sorry`, `admit`, or `unsafe` declarations;
- formalizes the repaired low-rate theorem, including ambient subcode padding;
- contains 8,507 lines across roughly 43 Lean modules;
- assumes two project axioms for the cardinality and algorithmic clauses of Kopparty's differential-equation solver.

It therefore provides a valuable proof certificate for much of the interpolation pipeline, but not a fully verified root solver and, at the initially audited snapshot, not the uniform additive-gap parameter theorem. Its custom message, list, and code interfaces must be bridged to ArkLib's canonical APIs rather than copied as a second public Reed-Solomon frontend.

Its advertised algorithmic theorem also does not yet certify executable computation. `FieldCost α` is only a transparent pair of an arbitrary result and a claimed natural-number charge. In particular, `FieldCost.pure (decodingList ...)` can package the declarative answer at zero cost. The current top-level existence statement therefore cannot distinguish a genuine decoder from an oracle-like definition, even before accounting for the assumed Kopparty algorithm. We may reuse its finite linear-algebra implementation and mathematical filtering lemmas, but `R7`, `D0-D3`, and any runtime theorem need a stricter executable and compositional interface.

During this audit, canonical `kz99/rs-ld-mca` main advanced to `9699ee7a6143f6efe1d8cfed84998a4f8c79c40f`. The new `FreeParameters.lean`, `FreeRankThreshold.lean`, and `MainAllRate.lean` layer proves a free-derivative-order theorem for each fixed agreement `ε` and multiplicative slack `θ`. This is useful staging but is not yet the target uniform-gap theorem: its `d₀` is chosen from `(ε, θ)`, whereas our capstone must choose one `d(δ)` before seeing any rate. It also retains both Kopparty axioms and the weak `FieldCost` interface. The original development is by Kai Zhe Zheng. The free-order extension came through PR 1 from Pratyush Mishra; its code commit `b1e346f...` records `Codex <codex@openai.com>` as author and Pratyush Mishra as committer, and Kai Zheng merged it at `9699ee7...`. Preserve this provenance in adapted files.

The new head has now passed a separate clean audit at its own pins: `lake build --wfail`, the repository trust script, and `lean --trust=0` with warnings as errors on both the main module and axiom-audit module. No proof hole was found beyond the same two explicit Kopparty axioms. The original `82c1d5c...` snapshot remains recorded because it was the exact version first audited; new reuse work should pin `9699ee7...` or a later explicitly audited head.

The source repository has no visible license file at the pinned commits. The permission record now durably preserves Quang Dao's attestation that one of the source formalization's authors approved reuse for this formalization. It does not yet archive the direct grant, identify its grantor, or establish Apache-2.0 compatibility. Do not claim a blanket public license or license compatibility until direct evidence with adequate scope is added to that record.

### 4.3 Existing ArkLib work

The following unmerged branches have been audited as potential inputs:

| Source | Pinned head | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| PR 857, weighted multivariate support | `f37f25ba` | Rebase or cherry-pick as a clean foundation after review. No `sorry`. |
| PR 856, Hasse-Taylor infrastructure | `0c6d0a40` | Rebase or cherry-pick as a clean foundation after review. No `sorry`. |
| PR 855, list-decoding specification | `c7e9e01e` | Extract the generic contracts and prove the two filtering holes immediately. Do not import its stale low-rate capstone as verified. |
| Hidden-variable/substitution stack | `067acdff` | Port only the algebraic commits or files. Do not import the merge stack wholesale because it inherits PR 855's holes. |

The useful hidden-variable commits are `1b827589`, `71214c68`, and `d3370654`. Avoid the stack merge commits `3feac154` and `07cf41c1`.

### 4.4 Reuse estimate

The prior formalization and existing ArkLib branches substantially shorten the algebraic critical path. They cover most definitions and proof patterns for Hasse derivatives, hidden substitutions, local constraints, finite interpolation, Gaussian kernel extraction, filtering, and the repaired low-rate theorem. They do not remove the two hardest obligations:

1. formalizing differential-equation root counting and root enumeration without axioms;
2. proving a uniform all-rate parameter certificate with `d` depending only on `δ`.

With the fresh free-order layer and finite-cover wrapper, the practical estimate is that existing work removes 70 to 85 percent of the interpolation and parameter work for the first qualitative theorem, or roughly 45 to 60 percent of its complete axiom-clean critical path after ArkLib adaptation and root counting are included. It removes only about 25 to 35 percent of the explicit `172/(25δ)` path and less than 20 percent of an honestly executable decoder/runtime path. The remaining work contains the deepest independent arguments and most of the cross-library adaptation.

### 4.5 Accelerated qualitative route from the fresh donor theorem

The free-order theorem at donor commit `9699ee7...` can likely be wrapped into the required uniform additive-gap theorem by a finite rate cover. This is now the preferred phase-one parameter route, subject to a complete rounding audit.

Fix `δ`, put `h = δ/2`, and let `J = ceil((1-δ)/h)`. For `1 ≤ j ≤ J`, define `a_j = min(jh, 1-δ)`. The intervals `[a_j-h,a_j]` cover `[0,1-δ]`. For a positive endpoint `a = a_j`, set

```text
ε_a = a + h,
θ_a = h / ε_a = δ / (2a + δ).
```

Then

```text
(1 - θ_a) ε_a = a.
```

For every rate `r` in that interval, `r ≤ a` and `a-r ≤ δ/2`. Hence the actual message dimension lies below the donor ambient dimension, while

```text
ε_a ≤ r + δ.
```

The requested threshold `k + ceil(δn)` is therefore at least the donor threshold `ceil(ε_a n)`, using `ceil(k+x)=k+ceil(x)` for natural `k`. Take the maximum of the finitely many donor order thresholds `d₀(ε_a, θ_a)`.

For the remaining finite side conditions, put `a_min = min(h,1-δ) > 0` and `m=d^3`. It suffices to choose one `N(δ)` large enough that, for every `n ≥ N`,

```text
a_min n ≥ d + 2,
a_min n ≥ 4,
n ≥ m,
n > ceil(2m/a_min).
```

These inequalities uniformly give `d < K_a`, donor agreement threshold at most `n`, `mA_a ≤ n² ≤ q²`, and `B_a < n ≤ q`. This produces one coarse `d(δ)` and `N(δ)` before the code rate is known.

This finite-cover reduction offers the shortest qualitative path because it reuses the donor's already checked free-order rank comparison. It does not yield the paper's sharp `exp((172/25)/δ)` dependence, and it does not remove the Kopparty cardinality axiom by itself. The direct adaptive-padding and asymmetric-band paths remain necessary for the sharp theorem and provide an independent cross-check of the finite-cover proof.

## 5. Architecture and module ownership

New coding-theory modules should live under the following structure unless an implementation review finds a better existing namespace:

```text
ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/
├── ListDecoding/
│   ├── Specification.lean
│   └── AgreementRadius.lean
├── HiddenDerivative/
│   ├── Parameters/
│   │   ├── Basic.lean
│   │   ├── Qualitative.lean
│   │   └── AsymmetricBand.lean
│   ├── Variables.lean
│   ├── Substitution.lean
│   ├── LocalIdentity.lean

│       ├── Lifting.lean
│       ├── Counting.lean
│       └── Extension.lean
└── AllRateListDecoding/
    └── Main.lean
```

Generic Hasse-derivative, polynomial-divisibility, weighted-support, and finite-dimensional linear-algebra lemmas belong in existing generic namespaces under `ArkLib/ToMathlib` or `ArkLib/Data`, not in a coding-theory module. Coding-theory files may depend on generic files, never the reverse.

`ArkLib.lean` is generated. Contributors must not edit it by hand. Regenerate it once per integration wave with `./scripts/update-lib.sh` after new files have been staged.

The phase-one combinatorial critical path is approximately

```text
foundations
  -> local hidden identity
  -> local constraints and rank
  -> global interpolation
  -> differential identity
  -> root counting
  -> all-rate capstone.
```

The root-finding lane is independent of most interpolation work and should start immediately. The uniform-parameter lane is also independent after its exact finite inequalities have been specified. These two lanes should never wait behind routine porting.

## 7. Work packages and acceptance criteria

Status values are `blocked`, `queued`, `active`, `review`, and `landed`. A node is `landed` only when it is on the integration branch and passes its stated checks.

### 7.1 Governance and foundations

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Record provenance, permission, source commits, and citation keys. | None | active (project-owner attestation recorded; direct grant evidence pending) | Every imported file names its source and commit; bibliography entries build; permission record is durable. |
| S0 | Freeze exact Lean statements for combinatorial, exact-decoder, characteristic, and refinement theorems. | None | landed (`7715c089`) | Quantifier order visibly gives `d = d(δ)` before all code parameters; edge cases and radius conversion are explicit. |
| F0 | Integrate and re-audit PR 857 weighted-support API. | P0 | landed (`5bc284d7`) | Head `f37f25ba` is represented without regressions; no zero-weight finrank theorem is misapplied. |
| F1 | Integrate and re-audit PR 856 Hasse-Taylor API. | P0 | landed (`611afa07`) | Head `0c6d0a40` is represented; characteristic-safe identities and divisibility canaries pass. |
| F2 | Port ArkLib-native list specification, agreement-radius bridge, ambient subcode, and exact filtering contracts. | P0, S0 | landed (`d970f64c`, `45f98802`) | Uses canonical `ReedSolomon.code` and `Code.Lambda`; closes PR 855's two filtering holes; contains no stale low-rate capstone. |
| F3 | Port hidden variables and substitution bounds. | P0, F0 | landed (`33f1f3ac`) | Only algebraic commits are adapted; `D > d` is explicit; boundary canaries cover truncated natural subtraction. |
| F4 | Port the audited free-order donor explainer layer at `9699ee7...`. | P0 | landed foundation (`52903c27`) | Reusable finite-order and threshold lemmas are adapted to ArkLib; no pointwise `(ε,θ)` quantifier is mistaken for uniform `d(δ)`; both Kopparty axioms and the weak cost wrapper remain outside trusted endpoints. |

The weighted-degree finrank theorem currently requires nonzero variable weights. The hidden-derivative weight gives weight zero to `X`, `Y₀`, and `Y₁`. `I0` must therefore define a genuinely finite interpolation band with separate caps or an exact finite index type. Treating the unrestricted zero-weight space as finite-dimensional would be a correctness bug.

### 7.2 Hidden-derivative interpolation

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | Connect actual polynomials and Hasse jets to the hidden local substitution, including the normalized error divisible by `T^d`. | F1, F3 | landed (`33f1f3ac`, `592458da`) | The theorem specializes a genuine `P` and proves the exact divisibility used by local constraints. |
| L1 | Turn the local identity into order-`m` contact at an agreement point. | L0 | queued | No characteristic restriction beyond the algebraic identity; all truncation indices are checked. |
| I0 | Define the exact finite interpolation monomial band and its coefficient space. | F0, F3 | landed (`9b188640`, registration `2f96648f`) | Fintype and basis are explicit; zero-weight variables have finite caps; evaluator agrees with paper weights. The bridge to `C0`'s executable dimension index remains active under `0 < d < D`. |
| I1 | Define differential specialization `Y_j ↦ P^[j]` and prove its degree bound. | F0, F1 | queued | Uses exact derivative weights where possible; proves strict `< mA`, including all floor and ceiling cases. |
| I2 | Define local and global homogeneous linear constraint maps. | I0, L0 | queued | Coordinate and polynomial formulations are equivalent; constraints are executable over finite fields. |
| I3 | Formalize the intermediate map `Γ` and exhibited kernel. | I2 | queued | The map factorization is explicit; kernel elements are independent; no claim equates the upper bound with true rank. |
| I4 | Derive the certified local-rank upper bound. | I3, C0 | queued | Exact finite sum is proved; the distinction between `Φ` and `Γ` is maintained. |
| I5 | Prove existence of a nonzero global interpolant from the strict dimension inequality. | I0, I1, I4, U3 | queued | Finrank comparison and nonzero-kernel extraction are axiom-clean; interpolation polynomial satisfies every local constraint. |
| I6 | Prove that `A` agreements force the specialized differential polynomial to vanish identically. | I5, L1 | queued | Establishes `mA` total root multiplicity and strict specialization degree; arbitrary distinct evaluation points are used correctly. |
| D0 | Give a checked finite-field linear solver for interpolation. | I0, I2 | queued | Returned nonzero coefficient vector lies in the kernel whenever the dimension certificate holds. |

### 7.3 Uniform all-rate parameters

#### Route A: finite-cover wrapper for the first coarse theorem

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V0 | Define a finite `δ/2`-mesh covering every feasible rate in `[0,1-δ]`. | S0 | active (primitives at `7715c089`) | Every feasible `k/n` has a positive bin endpoint `a` with `k/n ≤ a ≤ k/n+δ/2`; endpoints give valid `ε_a,θ_a ∈ (0,1)`. |
| V1 | Instantiate the donor free-order theorem in every rate bin. | V0, F4 | queued | Proves `(1-θ_a)ε_a=a`, ambient containment, and threshold monotonicity with exact floors and ceilings. |
| V2 | Take finite maxima of derivative and block-length thresholds. | V1 | queued | Produces `d(δ),N(δ)` before `n,k,q`; uniformly discharges `d<K`, `B<q`, and `mA≤q²` from `n≥N,q≥n`. |
| V3 | Replace the donor root axiom by `R6` and package the uniform additive-gap theorem. | V2, F2, I6, R6 | queued | Exact list theorem has the required quantifier order, arbitrary evaluation points, and no project axioms. |

Route A is the preferred phase-one path. Its output may have a very poor non-explicit dependency on `δ`, but that is allowed because it preserves every qualitative strengthening.

#### Route B: direct uniform interpolation analysis

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0 | Formalize exact finite counting functions for bands, shells, and local-rank sums. | F0 | landed (`7935aaa5`, registration `2d8216d9`) | Finite sums correspond bijectively to interpolation indices; small numerical instances are executable canaries. |
| C1 | Prove coarse simplex/lattice bounds sufficient for positive power saving. | C0 | queued | Floors and ceilings are included; constants need not be optimized; no unjustified real-to-natural rounding. |
| U0 | Formalize ambient padding `K = k + floor(λ δ n)` and uniform geometry. | S0 | queued | Proves a positive ambient-rate lower bound and agreement-to-ambient-rate ratio `> 1`, uniformly over every `0 ≤ k/n ≤ 1-δ`. |
| U1 | Prove a local-rank power saving whenever the ratio exceeds one. | U0, C1 | queued | Derives `O(d^{-s})` for some `s(δ) > 0`; no small-agreement hypothesis. |
| U2 | Extract one finite `d(δ)` and `N(δ)` independent of the rate. | U0, U1 | queued | Quantifier order passes the uniformity test; all side conditions such as `D > d` and individual degrees are included. |
| U3 | Package a finite interpolation certificate valid for all rates and all `n ≥ N(δ)`. | U2, C0 | queued | Strict dimension-versus-rank inequality is available in exactly the form required by `I5`. |

Phase one should use the simplest sound padding and lattice argument, such as midpoint or fixed-fraction padding. Optimizing `λ`, asymmetric bands, or the derivative exponent belongs in `O0` and `O1` after the qualitative theorem composes.

Route B is no longer required to precede `M0` if Route A succeeds. It remains a high-value independent proof path, a prerequisite for the paper's sharp quantitative analysis, and a safeguard if the donor theorem proves awkward to adapt to ArkLib.

### 7.4 Differential root counting and enumeration

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Define differential polynomials, solutions of bounded degree, highest active derivative, and regular jets. | S0, F1 | landed (`14c56aaa`) | Definitions support partial derivatives in `Y_j`, specialization, recursion, and characteristic bounds. |
| R1 | Prove derivative descent to a nonzero highest-variable derivative. | R0 | landed (`14c56aaa`) | Positive individual degree `< char(F)` prevents formal differentiation from annihilating dependence. |
| R2 | Prove unique coefficient lifting from a nonsingular initial Hasse jet. | R1 | active; top-coordinate one-step theorem landed (`71207d79`, registration `9aa107f2`) | Every recurrence coefficient is explicit; nonvanishing binomial coefficients follow from the characteristic bound. The arbitrary-highest-jet restriction bridge and iterated fixed-jet uniqueness remain. |
| R3 | Prove singular solutions are covered recursively by derivatives of the differential polynomial. | R1 | active | Recursion terminates under a lexicographic or total individual-degree measure; all solutions enter a regular branch. |
| R4 | Count regular witnesses and solutions over a sufficiently large field. | R2, R3 | queued | Proves the division-free inequality `(S-H) * card Roots ≤ S * Δ * S^d`; specialization degree bounds the exceptional points. |
| R5 | Construct a finite extension large enough for witnesses. | R4 | queued | Extension degree is explicit; cardinality and characteristic facts are proved using mathlib finite-field APIs. |
| R6 | Descend the root count to base-field solutions. | R5 | queued | Injection of base solutions is formal; first capstone obtains a proved `q^(4d+6)`-type or better bound. |
| R7 | Implement and verify root enumeration. | R2, R3, R5 | queued | Enumeration is complete and sound; termination is proved; any runtime theorem uses an explicit cost model. |

This lane is expected to be the main schedule risk. ArkLib's existing Hensel code is specialized to a different trivariate rational-function setting and is not a substitute. Kai Zhe Zheng's formalization states the needed cardinality and algorithmic results as axioms, so those declarations may guide interfaces but cannot discharge `R1` through `R7`.

### 7.5 Composition and refinements

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Construct ambient candidate decoder from interpolation and differential roots. | D0, I6, R6 | queued | Every high-agreement message appears among candidates. |
| D2 | Filter candidates by degree `< k` and exact agreement threshold. | F2, D1 | queued | Filter is executable; soundness, completeness, and cardinality monotonicity are proved. |
| D3 | Prove exact decoder theorem. | D2, R7 | queued | Decoder output equals the target finite set for every input satisfying hypotheses. |
| M0 | Compose the all-rate combinatorial theorem. | F2, I6, R6, V3; alternatively the independently audited direct `U3` path | queued | Gold qualitative scope, `d = d(δ)`, arbitrary evaluation set, and no project axioms. |
| M1 | Compose the algorithmic theorem. | M0, D3 | queued | Exact output and list bound are proved; runtime is claimed only if formally modeled. |
| O0 | Formalize adaptive padding, variance/Cantelli estimates, and asymmetric interpolation band. | C0, I4, U0 | queued | Reproduces a mechanically checkable sharp finite certificate. |
| O1 | Prove the paper's explicit `d(δ) ≤ ceil(exp(6.88/δ))` regime or the strongest corrected constant. | O0 | queued | Every numerical inequality is kernel-checked; no decimal is trusted without a rational enclosure. |
| O2 | Prove `d = 0` for `δ ≥ 1/2` and `d = 1` for `1/4 ≤ δ < 1/2`, if these remain correct under final audit. | M0 | queued | Boundary values, ceilings, and empty-list cases are explicit. |
| O3 | Formalize sharpened root counts `O_δ(q^(2d))` and `O_δ(q^d)` under the larger-field hypothesis. | R6 | queued | Includes the corrected characteristic condition `char(F) > max(D,t)` and fixed-parameter runtime scope. |
| O4 | Formalize the shrinking-gap result `δ_n = C/log n` for `C > 13.76`. | O0 | queued | Statement matches paper commit `81c12b0...`; all asymptotic quantifiers are formal and no fixed-gap theorem is conflated with it. |
| O5 | Formalize field descent, resonance, and other qualitative refinements selected for the paper's final theorem suite. | M0 | queued | Each theorem has an independent value and does not weaken characteristic hypotheses. |
| N0 | Formalize the exact-capacity bad-ball construction. | M0 | queued | Gives exponentially many codewords at the endpoint, including ceiling conventions. |
| N1 | Formalize the `exp(Ω(1/δ))` arbitrary-evaluation-set lower bound. | M0 | queued | Coset construction and parameter regime are exact; no unsupported asymptotic shorthand. |
| N2 | Formalize the bounded-characteristic obstruction to jet lifting. | R0 | queued | Gives an explicit counterexample such as `Q = Y₁`, `P = H(X^p)` and states precisely what fails. |

The paper source, rather than an earlier agent report, controls `O4`. The pinned paper states `δ_n = C/log n` for `C > 13.76`; any later source change requires a statement re-audit before implementation.

### 7.6 Independent audits

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Initial status | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A0 | Source-correspondence and statement audit by a contributor who did not write the capstone. | M0 and advertised refinements | queued | Every hypothesis and quantifier is traced to a proof obligation; all claimed paper improvements have exact Lean counterparts. |
| A1 | Mutation tests and boundary canaries. | A0 | queued | Tests fail when rate dependence is reintroduced, strict inequalities are weakened, evaluation injectivity is removed, or characteristic bounds are dropped. |
| A2 | Trust, dependency, style, and clean-clone audit. | A1 | queued | Full validation and axiom sweep pass from a fresh clone; generated imports and blueprint links are current. |
| G0 | Verified-result release gate. | A2 | queued | Human owner reviews the audit report and explicitly approves announcement or upstream PR. |

## 8. Parallel execution waves

The graph is designed for more contributors than the four-agent local limit. Within each wave, every listed lane can proceed in its own worktree. When only four slots are available, always keep the root-solver and uniform-parameter lanes occupied because they dominate risk.

### Wave 0: freeze and import

Run concurrently:

1. `S0 + F2`: freeze ArkLib-native theorem and decoder contracts.
2. `F0 + I0`: integrate weighted support and design the finite zero-weight-safe band.
3. `F1 + L0`: integrate Hasse-Taylor and prove the missing actual-polynomial bridge.
4. `R0 + R1`: begin differential root-finding definitions and derivative descent.
5. `P0 + F3`: record provenance and adapt hidden-variable substitutions.
6. `F4`: audit and selectively port the new donor free-order layer.

### Wave 1: algebraic cores

Run concurrently:

1. `L1 + I2`: local contact and constraint map.
2. `I1`: differential specialization and degree.
3. `C0 + C1`: exact counts and coarse lattice estimates.
4. `U0 + U1`: uniform ambient geometry and positive power saving.
5. `R2 + R3`: unique lifting and singular recursion.
6. `D0`: checked interpolation linear solver.
7. `V0 + V1`: formalize the finite rate cover and its donor parameter instances.

### Wave 2: global composition prerequisites

Run concurrently:

1. `I3 + I4`: kernel and local rank.
2. `U2 + U3`: rate-independent parameter extraction.
3. `R4 + R5 + R6`: witness counting, finite extensions, and base-field bound.
4. `F2 + D2`: close the exact filtering contracts.
5. `V2 + V3`: take uniform finite maxima and assemble the additive-gap wrapper.

### Wave 3: first qualitative theorem

Run concurrently:

1. `I5 + I6`: global interpolant and differential identity.
2. `M0`: compose the theorem as prerequisites land.
3. `R7 + D1 + D3`: executable root and exact decoder path.
4. `A0`: begin statement audit against a frozen theorem candidate.

The first public-quality milestone is `M0` plus `A0-A2`. `M1` may follow if algorithm extraction takes longer, but the branch must not claim an algorithm before `D3` is complete.

### Wave 4: quantitative refinements and limitations

Run `O0-O5` and `N0-N2` in separate worktrees. These nodes should consume the stable phase-one interfaces rather than rewrite the capstone. Quantitative improvements should be added as stronger corollaries or alternate parameter packages.

## 9. Hardest blockers and mitigations

| Risk | Why it is hard | Mitigation and early test |
|---|---|---|
| Differential root solver | Requires recursive partial differentiation, nonsingular Hasse lifting, characteristic-sensitive binomial units, finite extensions, counting, and possibly executable enumeration. The available formalization assumes it. | Start `R0-R3` immediately. Prove a univariate-in-highest-derivative toy theorem first. Keep cardinality and algorithmic clauses separate. |
| Local rank argument | The paper bounds the rank through an intermediate map and an exhibited kernel. Confusing this upper bound with exact rank would invalidate the proof. | Give `Φ` and `Γ` distinct types and names. State only `rank Φ ≤ rank Γ ≤ bound`. Add small-field executable rank comparisons as canaries. |
| Zero-weight interpolation variables | Existing weighted finrank assumes nonzero weights, while `X`, `Y₀`, and `Y₁` have weight zero in the high-derivative band. | Build an exact finite index type with individual caps and degree inequalities. Never infer finiteness from the high-derivative weight alone. |
| Uniform all-rate quantifiers | Pointwise padding can accidentally choose `d` after the rate. Floors near `k = 1` and `k = n - ceil(δn)` are delicate. | Freeze the quantifier order in `S0`. Make `U2` return one package before it receives `k`. Add a theorem-level canary that specializes the same `d` at two extreme rates. |
| Characteristic assumptions | Hasse algebra works in small characteristic, but unique coefficient lifting can fail. Field cardinality does not by itself imply safe characteristic outside prime fields. | Keep prime-field capstone primary. Carry `D < char(F)` and individual-degree bounds through the generic root theorem. Formalize `N2` as a regression test. |
| Porting `rs-ld-mca` | It uses Lean 4.32.0, custom coefficient-vector messages, and custom list predicates; ArkLib uses Lean 4.33.1 and canonical code APIs. | Port proof kernels, not the duplicate frontend. Build small bridge lemmas first. Preserve source comments and compare theorem signatures line by line. |
| Sharp analytic constants | Variance/Cantelli, asymmetric bands, harmonic estimates, exponentials, and rounding can overwhelm the main proof. | Land the coarse existential `d(δ)` theorem first. Isolate all refined analysis behind the same finite certificate interface. Use rational enclosures for decimal constants. |
| Runtime claims | A field-operation estimate is not automatically a verified executable complexity theorem. | Keep runtime out of `M0`. Introduce a separate cost semantics before `M1` advertises complexity. |
| Long-lived fork divergence | PRs 856 and 857 may later land upstream in squashed form, producing duplicate semantic patches. | Pin every imported head. During upstream sync, compare patch IDs and deliberately drop equivalent patches rather than blindly merging histories. |

## 10. Single-branch integration protocol

There is exactly one canonical integration branch:

```text
quang/all-rate-rs-capacity-formalization
```

Contributors and agents may use temporary branches and worktrees, but every accepted result must be integrated into this branch. No parallel branch is a second source of truth.

### 10.1 Claiming work

Before editing, a contributor records:

- node ID;
- temporary branch and worktree;
- files owned;
- expected prerequisite commit on the integration branch;
- theorem or executable acceptance target.

No two active nodes should own the same implementation file. Shared generic lemmas should be requested through a small dedicated prerequisite node instead of copied between branches.

### 10.2 Landing work

For each node:

1. Rebase or merge the latest integration branch into the temporary branch.
2. Run targeted Lean files with warnings as errors.
3. Run the relevant repository validation, including axiom validation for theorem-bearing changes.
4. Obtain an independent review of statement shape and trust surface.
5. Integrate by a reviewed merge or cherry-pick that preserves source attribution.
6. Update this tracker in the same integration commit or the immediately following commit.
7. Notify dependent owners to rebase only after the integration commit is pushed.

Do not cherry-pick merge commits from the old hidden-substitution stack. Do not resolve `ArkLib.lean` conflicts manually. Stage source files and regenerate the import root after integration.

### 10.3 Checkpoint cadence

Push the integration branch after each coherent landed node or small dependency cluster. A checkpoint should build, should not introduce new untracked proof holes, and should leave this tracker accurate. Temporary contributor branches may be force-pushed; the integration branch must not be force-pushed after others base work on it.

## 11. Validation matrix

Every theorem-bearing integration should run the narrowest relevant checks plus the eventual full gate.

```bash
lake build <changed-module>
lake env lean --trust=0 <changed-file> -DwarningAsError=true
./scripts/validate.sh --axioms
```

For documentation-only changes, use:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --docs
```

Before `G0`, run the full validation suite from a clean clone and record:

- branch commit;
- Lean and mathlib pins;
- full build result;
- warning result;
- source trust audit;
- `#print axioms` output for every capstone;
- blueprint build and declaration-link status.

### 11.1 Mathematical boundary tests

The suite must cover at least:

- `A > n`, where the exact list is empty;
- smallest allowed `n` and `k = 1`;
- rates close to zero and close to `1 - δ` using the same chosen `d(δ)`;
- `q = n` when `n` is prime;
- arbitrary nonconsecutive evaluation points;
- agreement exactly `k + ceil(δn)` and one below it;
- strict versus non-strict specialization-degree bounds;
- `D = d` as a rejected boundary for truncated derivative weights;
- individual differential degree equal to the characteristic as a rejected root-lifting boundary;
- small-characteristic counterexamples;
- floors and ceilings for rational test gaps;
- equality between decoder output and the declarative target set.

### 11.2 Proof-mutation canaries

At least one audit worktree should verify that the proof breaks when each of these is intentionally changed:

- move the choice of `d` inside the rate quantifier;
- replace ambient `K` by the actual small `k` in the invalid dimension step;
- remove injectivity of the evaluation map;
- replace the strict dimension/rank inequality by a non-strict one;
- identify the intermediate-map rank bound with the true local rank;
- drop `D < char(F)` or the individual-degree characteristic condition;
- use the nonzero-weight finrank theorem with zero weights;
- skip the final degree and agreement filter.

## 12. Initial audit ledger

| Item | Result as of 2026-09-04 |
|---|---|
| Personal fork | Created at `quangvdao/ArkLib`; public due to GitHub fork rules. |
| Integration branch | Created and pushed from upstream main `22dbd4e836c15a21f68889afa69b7130da04abbb`. |
| Local integration worktree | `/Users/quangdao/Documents/Lean/ArkLib-all-rate-rs-capacity`. |
| `rs-ld-mca` source | Cloned and pinned at `82c1d5c00820f74a7ec18be716c033430bef5ae8`. |
| `rs-ld-mca` fresh upstream | Main moved during the audit to `9699ee7a6143f6efe1d8cfed84998a4f8c79c40f`; its free-order layer is useful but is pointwise in `(ε, θ)`, not uniform in the additive gap `δ`. |
| `rs-ld-mca` fresh-head validation | At its own pins, full warning-clean build, lexical trust check, and `lean --trust=0` checks on main and axiom-audit modules passed. |
| `rs-ld-mca` build | `lake build --wfail` passed. |
| `rs-ld-mca` trust check | Main file passed `lean --trust=0`; project script passed. |
| `rs-ld-mca` proof holes | No `sorry` or `admit`; two explicit Kopparty project axioms remain. |
| `rs-ld-mca` runtime claim | The `FieldCost` carrier permits arbitrary results with arbitrary stated charges, so the top-level algorithmic existence theorem is not an executable-computation certificate. |
| PR 856 Hasse-Taylor | Landed on the integration branch at merge `611afa07`, with source head `0c6d0a40` preserved as merge ancestry. Targeted builds, trust-zero warning-as-error checks, characteristic-two canaries, source-trust checks, and axiom inspection passed. |
| PR 857 weighted support | Landed on the integration branch at merge `5bc284d7`, preserving the seven source patches through `f37f25ba`; targeted builds, warning-as-error checks, import regeneration, source-trust checks, and axiom inspection passed. The zero-weight finrank limitation is documented explicitly. |
| PR 855 specification | Useful design, but two filtering sorries and one stale low-rate theorem sorry; do not import as verified. |
| Hidden substitution stack | Builds, but inherits PR 855 holes; port only selected algebraic commits. |
| ArkLib root solver | No suitable reusable implementation found. |
| Advanced lattice analysis | No reusable ArkLib library sufficient for the sharp derivative dependence found. |
| Donor port to ArkLib 4.33.1 | First 19 of 51 original modules compile unmodified. `GlobalDimension.lean` needs moderate Fin/Finsupp API repairs; the new parameter and free-threshold modules themselves compile over compatible dependency oleans. |
| All-rate contracts | Landed at merge `7715c089`. The exact threshold, `Code.Lambda` radius, qualitative all-rate quantifier order, strong derivative-order target, and larger-field refinement are frozen. The decoder contract is intentionally extensional and noncomputable; executable enumeration and cost remain separate obligations. |
| Ambient filtering and radius bridge | Landed at `d970f64c` and `45f98802`. The two filtering holes from PR 855 are proved. The point-list/evaluation-image equality and its `Code.Lambda` corollary include the exact `Nat.ceil` rounding and do not require injectivity of evaluation. |
| Axiom-free donor foundation | Landed at merge `52903c27`: six modules covering free-order parameters, a finite zero-weight-safe interpolation space, repaired rectangular dimension counting, scoped finrank bounds, and canaries. Kopparty assumptions, `FieldCost`, and algorithmic wrappers were excluded. |
| Hidden substitutions and local identity | Landed at `33f1f3ac` and completed at `592458da`: local variables, factored and normalized substitutions, weighted bounds with explicit `d < D`, the genuine-polynomial Hasse identity, canonical reduced error, characteristic-two canaries, and an algebra-hom identity with the root solver's canonical specialization after affine Taylor translation. |
| Differential root foundation | Landed at `14c56aaa`: bounded differential solutions, scalar and polynomial jets, active/highest jets, separants, regularity, exact root-specialization weights, characteristic contracts, and nonannihilating highest-variable derivative descent. `ZMod 2` versus `ZMod 3` canaries check the strict characteristic boundary. |
| Regular one-step lifting | Landed at merge `71207d79` with generated imports at `9aa107f2`: the exact logical existence-and-uniqueness clause of Kopparty's Theorem 4.4, generic first-order multivariate Taylor and Hasse-lifting support, and sharp `ZMod 2`/`ZMod 5` canaries. An independent audit found no mathematical blocker. The theorem currently uses the literal top jet and does not yet prove iterated fixed-jet uniqueness. |
| Exact finite counting | Landed at `7935aaa5` with generated imports at `2d8216d9`: executable higher-jet simplex and shell counts, the exact staircase dimension sum, exact contact budgets, and a strict finite interpolation certificate. The certified enlarged-map rank budget is explicitly not claimed to equal the actual local rank. |
| Exact interpolation index | Landed at `9b188640` with generated imports at `2f96648f`: finite coarse and exact derivative-weighted monomial indices, canonical basis and coefficient projections, strict floor bounds, and a proved coarse-to-exact inclusion. The proof-facing index intentionally uses noncomputable `Set.Finite.toFinset`; executable enumeration remains a separate `D0` obligation. |

## 13. Decisions already made

The following project decisions do not need to be revisited unless a formal obstruction is found:

1. The work lives in Quang Dao's ArkLib fork, not the upstream Verified-zkEVM branch.
2. The single integration branch is `quang/all-rate-rs-capacity-formalization`.
3. The first theorem keeps the full all-rate, fixed-gap, `d(δ)`-only scope, even if constants are coarse.
4. The Kopparty root solver is a required proof obligation for the gold theorem.
5. The prior autoformalization is reused with explicit credit and independent review, not trusted wholesale.
6. ArkLib's canonical Reed-Solomon and list-decoding interfaces remain the public API.
7. Runtime is separated from combinatorial existence until an honest executable cost model exists.
8. Optimized constants and shrinking-gap results are layered refinements over a stable qualitative core.
9. No announcement or upstream PR is made before the independent axiom and statement audits pass.

## 14. Open decisions for the human authors

These questions do not block phase-one proof work, but should be resolved before publication or upstream submission:

1. Can direct evidence of the `kz99/rs-ld-mca` permission grant, including its grantor and scope, be archived or linked from [`docs/kb/sources/rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md`](docs/kb/sources/rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md)? The durable storage location is now fixed, but the direct grant and license-compatibility terms remain unrecorded.
2. Should the first upstream artifact expose only the axiom-clean combinatorial theorem, or wait for the fully verified executable decoder and cost theorem?
3. Should quantitative lower bounds and the small-characteristic obstruction ship in the first formalization release, or in a second refinement release after `M0` and `M1`?

Until those choices are made, contributors should prioritize the axiom-clean all-rate combinatorial critical path and keep optional results modular.

## 15. Next actionable assignments

The following nodes are already owned as of the latest update. Coordinate with the integration owner
before duplicating them:

- `R2`: the regular top-coordinate one-step theorem is integrated; the active remainder is the
  arbitrary-highest-jet restriction bridge and iterated fixed-jet uniqueness.
- `R3`: an active agent owns the singular/separant recursion and its well-founded measure.
- `I0`/`C0` bridge: an active agent is connecting the proof-facing exact interpolation index to
  the executable dimension count under the necessary boundary `0 < d < D`.
- `V0` plus theorem-independent `V2`: an external sprint owns the exact rate cover and uniform
  finite-threshold machinery.

The best independent assignments for additional contributors are, in priority order:

1. `V0` plus the theorem-independent part of `V2`: finish the exact finite rate cover, ceiling
   monotonicity, finite maxima, and uniform side-condition arithmetic. Leave the donor-theorem and
   root-solver premises as explicit inputs rather than axioms.
2. `U0`: formalize ambient padding and its rate-uniform inequalities independently of interpolation.
   Keep every floor, ceiling, positivity, and `D > d` side condition explicit.
3. `R4-R6` support: develop the generic finite-field counting, sufficiently-large extension, and
   base-solution injection lemmas needed for the division-free root-count inequality. Keep these
   files independent of the still-moving `R0-R3` interface where possible.
4. `I3-I4` support: port or independently prove the donor's scaled-shell and contact-envelope
   kernel lemmas in new files, coordinating exact count names with the `C0` owner. State only the
   exhibited-kernel rank upper bound, never equality with the true local rank.
5. `O0-O1` audit support: independently develop the continuous and discrete sharp-constant
   certificates in non-overlapping helper files. These are separate audit routes and should not
   share unproved numerical lemmas; final composition still waits for `C0`, `I4`, and `U0`.
6. `N0` or `N2`: formalize the exact-capacity bad ball or the bounded-characteristic obstruction.
   These are useful independent checks, but they do not replace a critical-path node.

An autoformalization agent should be given this entire document and the following operating
contract: fetch the current head of `quang/all-rate-rs-capacity-formalization`; name one node and its
owned files before editing; work on a temporary branch or worktree; do not edit this tracker or
`ArkLib.lean`; introduce no `sorry`, `admit`, project axiom, `unsafe`, or `native_decide`; run the
targeted build, trust-zero warning-as-error check, source-trust audit, and `#print axioms`; then
return a commit hash, exact theorem names, test evidence, and residual assumptions to the integration
owner. The integration owner alone updates this document, regenerates `ArkLib.lean`, and pushes the
canonical branch.

After `F3`, `F4`, and `R0-R1` land, assign `L0-L1`, `I0-I4`, `V0-V3`, and `R2-R3` immediately.
The root solver and local-rank proof are the two largest schedule risks; keep independent reviewers
on both rather than concentrating all effort on infrastructure or constants.
