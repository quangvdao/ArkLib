# Axiom sweep: whole-library kernel-level axiom and `sorry` accounting

Walks the compiled environment (the same data the kernel checked) and computes, for every
declaration in `ArkLib.*` and `ArkLibExamples.*` modules, the set of axioms its statement and proof ultimately
depend on — the same information as `#print axioms`, for the whole library at once.

Because this reads elaborated `.olean` data rather than source text, it sees exactly what
the kernel accepted: private declarations and instances are reported, compiler-generated
auxiliaries are traversed (their taint surfaces on the parent declaration), and no
source-level heuristics are involved. The sweep covers what the root modules transitively
import — pair it with the repo's import-completeness gate so every
source file is actually in scope; an unimported file is invisible to any kernel-level
census.

Known blind spots, shared with `#print axioms` (all environment-walking tools):
* structure-field **default values** and autoparams (`:= by sorry`) are re-elaborated at
  each use site and attach to no swept constant of the defining module;
* `example`s never enter the environment;
* files not transitively imported by the swept roots are invisible (pair with the repo's
  import-completeness gate).
A source-level `sorry` grep is the complementary check for the first two.

Modes (run after `lake build`):

```
lake exe axiomsweep                     # summary only
lake exe axiomsweep --out report.json   # also write the full per-declaration report
lake exe axiomsweep --check             # gate against scripts/axiom_baseline.json
lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline   # rewrite the baseline from the current build
```

The committed baseline (`scripts/axiom_baseline.json`) records the currently-known
`sorryAx`-tainted declarations and any declarations depending on non-standard axioms
(anything beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` — so native trust axioms
surface here too: `native_decide`-style tactics mint per-declaration
`…._native.<tactic>.ax_<number>_<number>` axioms, recorded under their owning
declaration). `--check` fails exactly when a declaration is tainted that the baseline
does not cover. When gaps are closed, `--check` reports them and stays green; run
`--update-baseline` to shrink the file in the same PR.

The baseline is an allowlist for `sorryAx` debt only. Native trust is held to PolyFun's
zero-debt rule instead: `neverAllowlistable` rejects any `._native.` axiom outside the
explicit `grandfatheredNativeTrust` list, so no baseline edit can widen the trusted
computing base. Exit codes are a contract with CI — `1` is a taint verdict, anything else
an infrastructure failure — which is why `main` traps uncaught exceptions into `2`.

`scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh` exercises all of this against the `AxiomSweepTestFixtures`
library, whose fixtures carry synthetic taint of each shape this file reasons about.

/-- The native trust this repository has already accepted, listed by full axiom name so
any acceptance is auditable in source rather than hidden in a JSON allowlist. ArkLib has
accepted none: the list is empty, and the floor below keeps it that way unless an entry
is consciously added here.

Fails closed: if a private-name index or module path shifts, an entry stops matching and
`--check` goes red until someone consciously re-accepts it. -/
def grandfatheredNativeTrust : List String := []

/-- Axioms that may never be baselined: native-compiler trust beyond what
`grandfatheredNativeTrust` already accepts. Unlike `sorryAx` debt — honest work in
progress, which the baseline is allowed to track — new native trust is a widening of the
trusted computing base, so no baseline edit can green it; remove the dependency instead.

This is the counterpart of PolyFun's zero-debt gate. PolyFun refuses a nonempty baseline
outright; ArkLib cannot, since it carries genuine `sorryAx` debt, so the floor applies the
same "cannot pre-authorize future taint" rule to the part of the baseline where widening
the TCB is at stake. -/

/-- Phase 1: DFS. Compute, for every constant reachable from the work list, an
under-approximation of the set of axioms it transitively depends on, memoised across
roots via `memo`. Also records the finalisation order — a topological order of the
dependency graph except inside mutual-inductive cycles.

`gray` marks constants whose dependencies are still being expanded. Back-edges (cycles,
which the kernel only permits inside mutual inductive families) contribute nothing in
this phase; `repair` below propagates to the true fixpoint. An axiom contributes itself
plus anything reachable through its *type* (matching Lean's own `CollectAxioms`). -/

/-- Phase 2: propagate to fixpoint. The DFS under-approximates inside mutual-inductive
cycles (a member's taint may not reach its siblings), and — because `memo` persists
across roots — anything finalised after reading such a member inherits the error.
Re-deriving every set in finalisation order until nothing changes computes the least
fixpoint of the closure equations: the true kernel-level axiom dependency set. This is
strictly more accurate than `#print axioms`, whose `CollectAxioms` has the same
mutual-family blind spot this phase repairs. Sets grow monotonically and are bounded,
so termination is immediate; in practice one or two passes suffice. -/
