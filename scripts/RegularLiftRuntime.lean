# Compiled regular-lifting regression checks

Run with `lake exe regular-lift-runtime`. These concrete vectors exercise CompPoly's executable
representation, including operations with opaque kernel definitions. They are runtime tests, not
proofs by native evaluation and not complexity certificates. The library's semantic refinement and
residual-invariant theorems remain kernel checked independently.
