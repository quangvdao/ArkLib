# ArkLib Scripts 

This directory contains various utility scripts for the ArkLib project.

## Available Scripts

### Build and Validation
- **`validate.sh`** - Recommended convenience wrapper for routine local validation
- **`build-project.sh`** - Compile-only helper (`lake build`)
- **`build_timing_report.sh`** - CI timing/report helper for clean builds, warm rebuilds, the native build, and the validation wrapper
- **`build_timing_metadata.py`** - Versioned attribution metadata writer/validator for timing artifacts
- **`test-build-timing-report.sh`** - Deterministic report, metadata, and workflow-policy fixtures
- **`update-lib.sh`** - Update ArkLib.lean with all imports from source files
- **`check-imports.sh`** - Check whether `ArkLib.lean` is up to date with all tracked source modules
- **`check-warning-log.py`** - Fail on scoped warning classes found in a captured build log
- **`AxiomSweep.lean`** (`lake exe axiomsweep`) - Kernel-level axiom/`sorry` accounting with a
  committed regression baseline (`axiom_baseline.json`); see "Axiom Sweep" below
- **`test-axiomsweep.sh`** - Executable fixture matrix certifying the axiomsweep tool itself
  (gate directions, native-trust floor, exit-code contract), against the synthetic-taint
  fixtures in `AxiomSweepTestFixtures/`
- **`source-trust-audit.py`** - Deterministic source-token inventory for constructs outside
  the environment sweep's visibility across `ArkLib/`, `ArkLibExamples/`, and `ArkLibTest/`,
  with optional Git-ref comparison
- **`test-source-trust-audit.py`** - Focused lexer/diff fixtures for the source inventory
- **`ToyProblemRuntime.lean`** (`lake exe toyproblem-runtime`) - Compiled small-parameter checks
  for KoalaBear sextic arithmetic, executable interleaved-RS extraction, and the C6.9 virtual
  output-oracle and exact-extractor paths
- **`HachiRuntime.lean`** (`lake exe hachi-runtime`) - Compiled small-parameter checks that the
  nonrecursive Hachi honest-prover path executes: the balanced committer, the computable honest
  lift quotient, the concrete Ajtai lift commitment, and the terminal reveal-and-check. `--full`
  additionally runs the whole composed opening and checks the verifier accepts — it passes, in
  about six minutes, which is why it is not gated: the honest sumcheck prover dominates the cost
  of the entire chain. `--timing` reports per-check costs
- **`check-docs-integrity.py`** - Check docs links and the `CLAUDE.md` symlink
- **`LintStyle.lean`** and **`LintStyle/Checks.lean`** (`lake exe lint-style`) - Lean-native,
  exception-free source policy, including import discipline, whitespace, headers, line/file size,
  and hazardous-Unicode checks. It verifies that every tracked Lean file under `ArkLib/` and `ArkLibTest/` file is in the
  `ArkLib.lean` closure, and independently rejects forbidden option and `nolint`-attribute syntax
  even if module code captures diagnostics or mutates Lean's in-process linter registry. This
  lexical backstop is deliberately conservative across literal bodies (and across comments for
  forbidden options), and reserves policy-like quoted identifiers and syntax quotations;
  suppression examples belong in the out-of-scope fixtures
- **`ArkLibLintPlugin.lean`** - end-of-module Lean syntax-tree gate rejecting `set_option` linter,
  pretty-printer, profiler, and trace changes and `@[nolint]` attributes, including suppressions
  nested in tactics, terms, extensible interpolated strings, and diagnostic-capturing commands.
  The plugin supplies precise syntax diagnostics; it is not presented as a sandbox against
  arbitrary hostile Lean metaprogramming, so the independent source pass remains mandatory

## Quick Start

### Recommended Routine Validation
```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

### Validation With Optional Checks
```bash
# Build API docs too
./scripts/validate.sh --docs

```

### Toy-Problem Runtime Gate
```bash
lake exe toyproblem-runtime
```

### Nonrecursive-Hachi Runtime Gate
```bash
lake exe hachi-runtime            # the fast checks; this is what validate.sh gates on
lake exe hachi-runtime --full     # also runs the composed opening (slow)
lake exe hachi-runtime --timing   # per-check timings
```

```

### Axiom Sweep

Kernel-level accounting of what every `ArkLib.*` and `ArkLibExamples.*` declaration ultimately
depends on — the
same information as `#print axioms`, computed for the whole library at once from the built
`.olean` data (so private and macro-generated declarations are included and no source
heuristics are involved). Requires a completed `lake build`.

Building the executable links VCVio's FFI static libraries, whose C sources live in git
submodules that Lake does not fetch; `./scripts/validate.sh --axioms` and CI initialize
them automatically, but on a direct first `lake exe axiomsweep` you may need:

```bash
git -C .lake/packages/VCVio submodule update --init --recursive
```

```bash
# Summary: total declarations, sorryAx-tainted, non-standard-axiom-tainted
lake exe axiomsweep

# Full per-declaration report (name, module, kind, line, axioms)
lake exe axiomsweep --out /tmp/axiom-report.json

# Regression gate: fail iff current taint is not covered by the baseline
lake exe axiomsweep --check

# Refresh the baseline (after intentionally adding a tagged sorry, or after
# closing gaps); commit the resulting diff in the same PR
lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline
```

The committed baseline makes the distinction the repo cares about mechanical. Pre-existing
`sorry` gaps are allowed while recorded; additions fail `--check` until an intentional
`lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline` diff is reviewed and committed. Removed debt is
reported without failing so cleanup is never discouraged; refresh the baseline in the same
PR. The baseline is an allowlist for `sorryAx` debt only; native-compiler trust (`Lean.ofReduceBool`,
`Lean.trustCompiler`, and the per-declaration `…._native.<tactic>.ax_<n>_<n>` axioms
minted by `native_decide`-style tactics) is never allowlistable — `--check` fails on it
regardless of the baseline, and `--update-baseline` refuses to write while it is present.
CI and `./scripts/validate.sh --axioms` both run the check enforcing.

The tool itself is certified by `./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh`, which builds the isolated
`AxiomSweepTestFixtures` library (deliberate synthetic taint of every shape the sweep
reasons about: direct and transitive `sorry`, axiom-in-type, mutual-inductive inheritance,
generated native-trust names and near-miss collisions, and an unimported file) and checks
report determinism, every gate direction, and the exit-code contract (`1` = taint verdict,
`2` = infrastructure failure). CI runs it as an enforcing step:

```bash
lake build AxiomSweepTestFixtures
./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh
```

### Source Trust Inventory

`source-trust-audit.py` complements axiomsweep by lexically scanning every tracked
Lean file under `ArkLib/`, `ArkLibExamples/`, and `ArkLibTest/`, whether imported or not. It masks nested comments, strings,
and quoted identifiers, then inventories exact admission, `example`, explicit-`axiom`, and
native/compiler-trust reference tokens. This sees admissions in examples and
defaults/autoparams that attach to no environment declaration. It deliberately reports rather
than bans `sorry` debt, and native references are conservative visibility because metaprogram
syntax quotations can mention a tactic without executing it. The kernel-level sweep owns the
enforcing taint verdict and zero-native-trust floor.

```bash
python3 scripts/test-source-trust-audit.py
python3 scripts/source-trust-audit.py --base-ref origin/main --json /tmp/source-trust.json
```

### `build_timing_report.sh`

Helper used by CI to measure and render build timings for clean builds, warm
rebuilds, the native build, and the `./scripts/validate.sh` path. The CI workflow uploads
timing-data artifacts so PR runs can compare against the successful push run for the PR's exact
base SHA without rerunning that base in the same job. It never silently substitutes a previous PR
update or a different `main` commit when the exact artifact is unavailable. Each artifact also
records the measured checkout, PR head/base, dependency-manifest hash, cache provenance, and runner
image; the report shows wall time beside `user + sys` CPU work. This supports
[`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

The four measurements share one tree and run in order, so each leaves it warmer than the last.
`native_build` exists to hold the `.c.o` chain that the compiled executables link
(`toyproblem-runtime` and `hachi-runtime`): that is the cost which swings on `.lake` cache state,
and billing it separately keeps the validation wrapper's row comparable across dependency bumps.
Any new compiled executable run by `validate.sh` has to be added to that command as well. See
[`../docs/wiki/quickstart.md`](../docs/wiki/quickstart.md) for how to read the rows.

`./scripts/test-build-timing-report.sh` exercises metadata validation, exact-base/missing-base
rendering, CPU deltas, native-command ownership, and the stale-run guard in the trusted reporter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (for Python scripts)
- Lean 4 (for Lean scripts)
- Graphviz (for dependency visualization)
- Virtual environment (`.venv`) for Python dependencies

## Notes

- Most scripts should be run from the ArkLib root directory
- Python scripts require the virtual environment to be activated
- Some scripts may require specific Lean toolchain versions
- `validate.sh` is the recommended local wrapper; use the lower-level scripts directly when you
  want to run or debug one piece in isolation
- `validate.sh` enforces a zero non-`sorry` warning budget across `ArkLib/**`
- New `ArkLib/**/*.lean` files must be staged before `update-lib.sh` or `check-imports.sh`
