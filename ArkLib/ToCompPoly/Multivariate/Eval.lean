  # Evaluation of computable multivariate polynomials, bundled and over `Finset`s

  Additions to `CompPoly.Multivariate.CMvPolynomialEvalLemmas`, not yet upstreamed to CompPoly.

  CompPoly records that `CMvPolynomial.eval vals` respects each ring operation separately
  (`eval_zero`, `eval_one`, `eval_add`, `eval_mul`, `eval_C`, …), which is what `simp`/`grind`
  need to normalize a *fixed* expression. Two things are missing for reasoning about a **family**
  of polynomials: the value of a bare variable, and commutation with `Finset.sum` / `Finset.prod`.

  Both follow at once from bundling: `CMvPolynomial.eval vals` is `eval₂Hom (RingHom.id R) vals`,
  so `map_sum` and `map_prod` apply verbatim. `evalHom` records that bundling; the two `Finset`
  lemmas are its immediate corollaries, stated in unbundled form so that call sites can rewrite
  without unfolding.

  These are the lemmas the Hachi sumcheck summands need
  (`Commitments/Functional/Hachi/ZeroCheck/Constraints.lean`): its constraint polynomials are
  built as a sum over the Boolean cube of a coefficient times a product of linear factors, so
  every evaluation argument crosses both a `Finset.sum` and a `Finset.prod`.

/-! ## Transporting a whole polynomial

The lemmas above are enough for statements about *values*. A statement about *degrees* is not
determined by values (two distinct polynomials agree everywhere over a finite field), so it has to
cross the representation boundary at the level of the polynomial itself, through
`fromCMvPolynomial`. That map is the forward direction of `polyRingEquiv`, hence a ring
homomorphism, so it too commutes with `Finset.sum` and `Finset.prod`. -/
