# The toy-protocol soundness experiment is the MCA experiment of the constrained code

This file formalizes the observation (G. Fenzi) that the soundness experiment of
the §6 toy reduction `T[C, t]` is the mutual-correlated-agreement (MCA) experiment
of the **constrained code** — the code obtained by adjoining the extra linear
constraint `⟨m, v⟩ = μ` to `C`. Two results, of increasing fidelity:

* `gamma_transition_prob_le_constrained` — an upper bound `toy γ-event ≤
  ε_mca(C_v, δ)` against the **stock** MCA error of the appended-coordinate code
  `C_v` (see the caveat: this over-counts, so it is only a bound).
* `gammaEvent_iff_constrainedMCAEvent` / `gammaEvent_prob_eq_constrainedMCAEvent` —
  a per-instance **equivalence**: under `hNoWit`, the toy γ-event coincides with the
  *constraint-pinned* event `ConstrainedMCAEvent` (constraint coordinate mandatory,
  proximity measured on the data coordinates). NB this is a restatement in MCA shape,
  **not** an equality with the library MCA experiment (`IsMCA`) of `constrainedCode` —
  `ConstrainedMCAEvent` is bespoke, phrased directly in `enc`/`v`, and its `¬`-clause
  is redundant under `hNoWit`; see the theorem docstring. The genuine reduction to the
  constrained code's MCA bad event is the `≤` bound above.

Concretely, for the scalar alphabet `A = F` we adjoin the constraint value
`⟨m, v⟩` as one extra coordinate (indexed by `Unit`):

  `constrainedCode enc v := range (m ↦ Sum.elim (enc m) (fun _ ↦ ⟨m, v⟩)) ⊆ (ι ⊕ Unit) → F`.

This keeps the code `F`-additive (it is the range of a linear map), turns the
affine constraint into an *exact* coordinate match, and makes the folded target
`μ₁ + γ·μ₂` the value of the line `f₁ + γ·f₂` at the extra coordinate.

The main result, `gamma_transition_prob_le_constrained`, shows that the
γ-round transition probability of the toy reduction (the event of
`ToyProblem.gamma_transition_prob_le` / the private `gammaEvent`) is bounded by

  `mcaError(AffineLineGenerator F, constrainedCode enc v, δ)`,

a **single** MCA quantity in which the linear constraint is internalized as a code
coordinate, so no separate `|Λ|/|F|` list-size term appears (compare the paper's
split bound `ε_mca(C, δ) + |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| / |F|` proved by
`ToyProblem.gamma_transition_prob_le`).

The proof is purely structural — no coding-theory external is invoked. The toy bad
event implies `IsMCA (AffineLineGenerator F) (constrainedCode enc v) γ U δ`, taking
the agreement set `S' = S ∪ {extra coordinate}`; the `+1` slack from the extra
coordinate absorbs the `(1-δ)` factor, so the *same* `δ` works with no proximity
rescaling.

## Caveat: this is an upper bound, not an equality or a proven improvement

The result is `toy γ-event ≤ mcaError(AffineLineGenerator F, C_v, δ)`, established by a
single `le_iSup`.
Two things it does **not** establish, and should not be read to:

* **Not an equality.** `IsMCA` (hence `mcaError`) quantifies over *all* agreement
  sets `S'` of size `≥ (1-δ)(n+1)`, including sets that *omit* the extra `Unit`
  coordinate. On such an `S'` the constraint is never tested, so that branch
  reduces to a plain base-code-`C` MCA bad event (at the larger `(1-δ)(n+1)` size
  budget). Hence `ε_mca(C_v, δ)` *over-counts* relative to the toy soundness and is
  only an upper bound on it, not equal to it. (No comparison with
  `mcaError(AffineLineGenerator F, C, δ)` is
  proved here in either direction: embedding a base agreement set `S ⊆ ι` into
  `ι ⊕ Unit` must clear the strictly larger `(1-δ)(n+1)` threshold, so the naive
  monotonicity argument fails.) The per-instance *equivalence* uses the **constraint-pinned**
  MCA event `ConstrainedMCAEvent` (constraint coordinate mandatory; proximity on the
  data coordinates `ι`) — see `gammaEvent_iff_constrainedMCAEvent`. Pinning into the
  *full* index `ι ⊕ Unit` with the stock `(1-δ)(n+1)` size budget does **not** give
  an equality: the backward direction loses a `δ` of slack (recovering only
  `|S ∩ ι| ≥ (1-δ)n - δ`), so the pinned event must measure size on `ι` only.

* **Not a proven improvement.** Whether `ε_mca(C_v, δ) ≤ ε_mca(C, δ) + |Λ|/|F|`
  (i.e. whether this single quantity is tighter than / equal to the paper's split
  bound, rather than looser) is **not** proved here, and is non-trivial: the
  `|Λ|/|F|` control on the constraint-pinned part of `mcaError` for `C_v` would itself
  need the counting argument of `gamma_transition_prob_le`. Treat the relationship
  to the paper bound as open.

## Scope

This is stated for the **scalar** specialization `A = F`,
where the `F`-valued constraint coordinate lives in the same alphabet as the
codeword. The general `F`-module alphabet `A` (folded RS, `A = Fin s → F`) would
require the constrained code to live in `(ι → A) × F`, i.e. a heterogeneous-alphabet
generalization of the current `mcaError` ambient — left as future work.

/-- **The toy-protocol γ-round soundness experiment is bounded by the MCA error of
the constrained code.** For an instance `(v, μ₁, μ₂, f₁, f₂)` of the toy reduction
admitting **no** relaxed-relation witness (`hNoWit`), the probability over a
uniform challenge `γ` that some message `m` satisfies the post-`γ` knowledge
state is at most `mcaError(AffineLineGenerator F, constrainedCode enc v, δ)`.

This is the constrained-code reformulation of `ToyProblem.gamma_transition_prob_le`
(`A = F`): the linear constraint is internalized as a code coordinate, so the bound
is a single MCA quantity with no separate `|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| / |F|` term.

**Caveat (one-directional).** This is an upper bound, established by a single
`le_iSup`. It is *not* an equality (`mcaError` for `C_v` over-counts: `IsMCA` admits
agreement sets omitting the constraint coordinate, which reduce to base-code-`C`
MCA events), and it is *not* shown to be `≤` the paper's split bound `ε_mca(C,δ) +
|Λ|/|F|`. See the module docstring's caveat section.

Directly, the toy bad event implies
`IsMCA (AffineLineGenerator F) (constrainedCode enc v) γ U δ`, witnessed by the agreement set

/-! ## The per-instance equivalence (constraint-pinned event, proximity on data coordinates)

The `≤` bound above over-counts, because `IsMCA` over `ι ⊕ Unit` admits agreement
sets that omit the constraint coordinate. An exact restatement of the toy γ-event in
MCA shape requires (i) the constraint coordinate to be mandatory and (ii) proximity
measured on the data coordinates `ι` only — pinning into the full index with the stock
`(1-δ)(n+1)` budget loses a `δ` of slack in the backward direction and fails to give an
equality. The resulting `ConstrainedMCAEvent` is a bespoke event (not the library
`IsMCA`/`mcaError` experiment of any code), so the equivalence below is a per-instance
restatement, not a reduction to the library MCA experiment.
-/

/-- **Constraint-pinned MCA event of the constrained code** (proximity measured on
the data coordinates `ι`; the constraint coordinate is mandatory but outside the
size budget). The folded constrained codeword (target `μ₁ + γ·μ₂`) agrees with the
folded word on `S`, while no constrained-codeword *pair* (targets `μ₁, μ₂`) agrees
with `(f₁, f₂)` on `S`. -/

/-- **Per-instance equivalence (constraint-pinned).** Under `hNoWit` (the instance
admits no relaxed-relation witness), the toy γ-event is equivalent, for every `γ`,
to `ConstrainedMCAEvent` — the toy event augmented with the (under `hNoWit`
automatically-satisfied) clause that no constrained-codeword *pair* agrees on `S`.

This is a per-instance restatement, **not** a reduction to the library MCA
experiment of `constrainedCode`: `ConstrainedMCAEvent` is a bespoke event phrased
directly in terms of `enc`/`v`, not via `constrainedCode` or `mcaError`, and the
added `¬`-clause is redundant under `hNoWit`. The genuine reduction to the
constrained code's MCA bad event is the upper bound
`gamma_transition_prob_le_constrained` above; that is the headline result.

Forward (`mp`, uses `hNoWit`): the toy event's witness set `S` satisfies the
`¬`-clause because a local witness on `S` would be a global witness. Backward
(`mpr`, no `hNoWit`): drop the `¬`-clause and read off the message `m`. -/
