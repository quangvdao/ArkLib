  # `Lift` — protocol layer

  The two-round `Lift` reduction, written once over an arbitrary
  `Presentation R S` (`Presentation.lean`) and the committed-scalar shell
  (`OracleReduction/Security/CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness/CommittedScalar.lean`). The
  protocol moves a linear claim over the quotient ring `S` into the field `F` where all
  later checking happens:

  * the prover commits to the **lifted witness** `(z, ρ)` — the `S`-witness of a linear
    relation `M z = y` together with one quotient polynomial per row, of degree `≤ d − 1`;
  * the verifier sends one scalar challenge `α ← F`;
  * the output relation checks the lifted row identities *evaluated at `α`*
    (`checkAt`), commitment consistency, and admissibility.

  The name records the first of these operations: `ρ` lifts equality in `S = R[X]/(φ)` to
  exact equality in `R[X]`; the random evaluation challenge then checks that lift in `F`.

  Soundness rests on the degree structure of the lift: each lifted row identity is a
  polynomial identity of degree `< 2d`, so openings passing `checkAt` at `2d`
  pairwise-distinct challenges determine it exactly, and the identity descends to `S`.
  Coordinate-wise special soundness therefore holds at plain `k = 2d` special soundness: the
  extractor is the committed-scalar assembler `CommittedScalar.treeExtractor`, and the single
  construction-specific obligation — one short opening passing `checkAt` at `2d`
  pairwise-distinct challenges recovers the input relation — is discharged **generically**
  by the presentation's interpolation engine (`recover`). An instance therefore supplies
  only:

  * a `Presentation R S` with its `IsPresentation` laws (e.g. the cyclotomic
    `cyclotomicPresentation` over `Rq Φ`,
    in `Commitments/Functional/Hachi/RingSwitch/Reduction.lean`);
  * how to read the linear statement off its statement type (`getM`, `getY`);
  * its admissibility predicates (`zOk` on input witnesses, `wShort` on lifted openings,
    `sideCond` on statements) and the one implication tying them together;
  * a `BindingCommitment` for the lifted witness.

  ## Where weak binding lives

  The commitment is only binding on short openings, so the certificate is the **escape-threaded**
  one: `package` is an `EscapeCWSSPackage` whose event is `CommittedScalar.escEvent`, i.e.
  "the tree's branch openings exhibit a short collision of the committed value". Relations and the
  extractor stay ordinary — nothing here is widened by a sum type, and the extractor returns a plain
  `Fin μ → S`. See `CommittedScalar.lean` for why the break has to be an event on `(statement,
  tree)` rather than an extractor output.

  ## Statement-type genericity

  The statement is an abstract `Stmt` with projections `getM : Stmt → Matrix _ _ S` and
  `getY : Stmt → Fin n → S`, so instances can carry extra public data (Hachi: the norm
  bound) without wrapping.

/-! ### The honest prover and completeness -/

/-- **The honest lifted witness** of a quotient-evaluation switch: the `R^lin` witness `z` together
with the per-row honest quotients `ρᵢ := (rowSumᵢ − rep yᵢ) /ₘ φ` (`Presentation.quotient`).

This is the honest prover's `computeW`, and it is total: the degree field is discharged by the
*unconditional* `Presentation.natDegree_quotient_le`, so no validity of the input statement is
needed to build the witness — validity is what makes it satisfy `checkAt`
(`checkAt_honestWitness`). `noncomputable` as stated: the quotients are Mathlib polynomials
obtained by division (`Presentation.quotient`), repackaged as canonical coefficient arrays by
`Polynomial.toImpl`; an executable prover restates the division over `CPolynomial` (e.g. Hachi's
`honestLiftWitnessC`) and transfers by an agreement lemma. -/

/-- **The honest opening passes the local check at every challenge.** At a valid statement
(`getM s *ᵥ z = getY s`) the honest quotients turn each row into an exact `R[X]` identity
(`Presentation.rowSum_eq_of_mulVec_eq`), and `evalAt φF a` is a ring homomorphism, so the identity
survives evaluation at *any* point `a`.

Quantifying over all `a` is what makes the completeness error of a quotient-evaluation switch
exactly `0`: the honest prover has nothing to fear from the challenge. The `sideCond` conjunct is
statement-level and is passed straight through. -/

/-- **Perfect completeness of a quotient-evaluation switch**, at error exactly `0`, over an
arbitrary input relation.

The input relation is a parameter rather than `relLin` because an honest prover needs *more* than
the plain linear relation: it needs the statement-level `sideCond` too, and for concrete instances
that condition is a property of the statement family (Hachi: the protocol's norm parameter is
dominated by the statement's public bound) which no relation on `(statement, z)` pairs implies. An
instance therefore threads it through its own input relation — the seam relation the preceding link
lands in — and discharges `hside` from membership. On the soundness side the same condition arrives
for free from the accepting transcript (`recover` reads it off `checkAt`), which is why only the
honest direction has to carry it.

The three obligations:

* `hrow` — the linear system holds (the substance of `relLin`);
* `hside` — the statement-level side condition;
* `hshort` — the honest lifted witness is **admissible** for the commitment's shortness regime.
  This is the honest-side range check of the paper's figure (Hachi Figure 4's `‖z‖∞ ≤ b − 1`,
  `‖r‖∞ ≤ b − 1`): a statement about the honest quotients' coefficient growth at the concrete
  parameters, invisible to the abstract `wShort`.

Everything else — commitment consistency, the check at every challenge, the impossibility of
failure — is discharged by `CommittedScalar.reduction_perfectCompleteness` and
`checkAt_honestWitness`. Error `0` because `checkAt_honestWitness` holds at every challenge. -/
