  # Quotient presentations — the data layer of `Lift`

  A ring `S` is *presented* as a quotient `R[X]/(φ)` when its elements carry canonical
  polynomial representatives below a monic modulus. That is all the `Lift`
  ring switch consumes — cyclotomic rings `R_q = Z_q[X]/(X^d + 1)` are one instance, not the
  definition. This file abstracts exactly that data, mirroring the
  `CyclotomicModulus`/`IsCyclotomic` split of the lattice layer:

  * `Presentation R S` — proof-free **computable** data: the monic modulus `φ : CPolynomial R`
    and a canonical representative map `rep : S → CPolynomial R`;
  * `IsPresentation P` — the laws, stated as the Mathlib semantics of that data (via `toPoly`):
    `φ` monic, representatives of degree `< deg φ`, `rep` injective, and `rep`
    additive/multiplicative *up to multiples of `φ`* (the coset laws).

  The carrier split is deliberate and matches the lattice layer: **data lives in the computable
  carrier, the laws are its `toPoly` semantics, and the proof engine never leaves
  `Polynomial`-land.** Mathlib's `Finsupp`-backed `Polynomial` has no computable values at all
  (not even `0`), so a presentation over it could neither be constructed concretely nor kept as
  an argument of a package that is meant to run.

  On top of the laws, this file proves the whole lift algebra of the switch. Here “lift” has
  its literal quotient-algebra meaning: replace equality modulo the modulus by an exact
  polynomial equality carrying an explicit quotient witness. The file supplies the
  equivalence between ring equations over `S` and polynomial identities over `R[X]` with an
  explicit quotient witness:

  `(M *ᵥ z) i = y i  in S    ↔    ∑ⱼ rep(Mᵢⱼ)·rep(zⱼ) = rep(yᵢ) + φ·ρᵢ  in R[X]`

  * the **exactness layer**: a modulus-multiple of degree below the monic modulus vanishes
    (`eq_zero_of_modulus_dvd_of_natDegree_lt`), so `rep` is additive *on the nose*
    (`rep_zero`, `rep_add`, `rep_neg`, `rep_sum`) — strictly stronger than the coset laws it
    is derived from;
  * `Presentation.rowSum` — the lifted left-hand side of a row — and its degree bound
    `≤ 2·deg φ − 2`;
  * `Presentation.mulVec_eq_of_rowSum_eq` / `Presentation.exists_rowSum_eq_of_mulVec_eq` —
    the two directions of the correspondence: lifted identities *descend* to `S`, and true
    row equations *lift* with an explicit quotient polynomial;
  * `Presentation.mulVec_eq_of_evalAt_rowSum` — the packaged per-row recovery engine: a
    lifted row identity that holds under `evalAt` at `2·deg φ` pairwise-distinct points of a
    field already descends to the row equation over `S`. (`evalAt` and the interpolation
    kernel it uses live one level up, in the family-shared
    `ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Transport/Eval.lean`.)

  No protocol imports: this is the algebra half; the committed-scalar protocol half lives in
  `Lift/Reduction.lean`.  Matrix–vector products are ArkLib's computable
  `ArkLib.Lattices.matVecMul`/`dot` (`Data/Lattices/Vectors.lean`), not Mathlib's
  `Matrix.mulVec`: instances such as `Rq Φ` have noncomputable ring instances, and the
  relations downstream are stated against the computable product.

  ## Instantiations

  The cyclotomic instance `cyclotomicPresentation` (with laws discharged from
  `Data/Lattices/CyclotomicRing/QuotientLift.lean`) realizes [NOZ26] Lemma 9's algebra —
  the [HMZ25] lift — over `Rq Φ`; see
  `Commitments/Functional/Hachi/RingSwitch/Reduction.lean`.

/-! ## The presentation data and its laws -/

/-- Proof-free presentation data for a ring `S` as a quotient `R[X]/(φ)`: the modulus and a
canonical representative map, over **computable** polynomials (`CPolynomial`). The laws live in
`IsPresentation` and speak about the `toPoly` semantics of this data, mirroring the
`CyclotomicModulus`/`IsCyclotomic` split, so that instances (e.g. Hachi's `Rq Φ`) can be
constructed without positivity or well-formedness side conditions — and so that concrete
presentations are ordinary values (Mathlib's `Finsupp`-backed `Polynomial` has no computable
values at all, not even `0`). -/

  /-- The modulus polynomial presenting `S`, e.g. `X^d + 1`. -/
  modulus : CPolynomial R
  /-- Canonical (degree-reduced) representative of a ring element. -/
  rep : S → CPolynomial R

/-- The presentation laws, stated as the Mathlib semantics (`toPoly`) of the computable data —
the `IsCyclotomic` idiom: monic modulus, degree-reduced injective representatives, and the
coset laws (`rep` is additive and multiplicative up to multiples of the modulus). The two
coset laws are the base compatibility facts; everything else the switch needs — sums, dot
products, the quotient-witness correspondence — is derived below.

`rep_injective` is injectivity of the *semantic* representative `s ↦ (P.rep s).toPoly`, which
is what the algebra below consumes and what the cyclotomic instance's `val_toPoly_injective`
provides verbatim; it implies injectivity of `P.rep` itself. -/

degree below the monic modulus, so it vanishes — `rep` is exactly additive. These are strictly

/-- **The per-row recovery engine**, over an arbitrary presentation: if a row's lifted
equation (with quotient `ρ` of degree `≤ d − 1`) holds under `evalAt` at `2d`
pairwise-distinct points of a field `F`, the row equation holds over `S`
([NOZ26] Lemma 9). The defect
polynomial has degree `< 2d`, so the `2d` roots kill it; the resulting `R[X]` identity
descends along the coset laws. The degree `d` is an explicit parameter tied to the modulus by
`hd`, so instances can state witnesses against their own degree expression.

The `2d` is **tight**, and it is the load-bearing constant of the whole lift: `P.rowSum M z i`
multiplies two degree-`< d` representatives, so `natDegree ≤ 2d − 2`, while
`P.rep (y i) + P.modulus * ρ` has `natDegree ≤ max (d − 1) (d + (d − 1)) = 2d − 1`. Both are
`< 2d`, so `2d` pairwise-distinct points force equality — matching [NOZ26] Lemma 9's "degree at
most `2d − 1`".

Note that `hA : Function.Injective A` with `A : Fin (2 * d) → F` implicitly requires
`2d ≤ ‖F‖`: over a carrier smaller than `2d` the hypothesis is unsatisfiable, so while the lemma
itself is proved unconditionally, no *application* to such an `F` can exist. This is benign in
context (the CWSS challenge tree could not exist either, and the paper's `(2d − 1)/|F_{q^k}|`
soundness error is only meaningful for `|F_{q^k}| > 2d`), but it is worth stating so that nobody
instantiates at a small carrier and believes something has been proved. -/
