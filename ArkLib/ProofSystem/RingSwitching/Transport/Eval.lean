# Evaluation through a ring embedding, and the interpolation kernel

The univariate leg of the claim-transport layer (see the folder umbrella
`ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Transport.lean`): move a polynomial identity with
coefficients in a base ring `R` into a target carrier `F`, check it there at points, and
recover the original identity from agreement at enough points.

* `evalAt φF a : R[X] →+* F` — evaluation of a base-ring polynomial at a carrier point `a`
  through the ring homomorphism `φF : R →+* F`, bundled as a ring homomorphism so transported
  identities follow from `map_add`/`map_mul`: any polynomial identity over `R[X]` holds under
  `evalAt φF a` for every `a`.
* `eq_of_evalAt_eq` — the **interpolation kernel**, the converse direction and the reason
  point-checking a transported identity is sound: two polynomials of `natDegree < N` that
  agree under `evalAt` at `N` pairwise-distinct points of a domain are equal.

Together they turn "an `R[X]`-identity of bounded degree" into "finitely many equations in
`F`" and back — the mechanism by which a reduction hands a base-ring claim to a carrier that
only ever sees evaluations (e.g. at verifier challenges).

The multivariate leg — coefficient-wise transport of degree-bounded polynomials — is the
sibling file `Coeffs.lean`. In this folder, `Lift`
(`RingSwitching/Lift/`) consumes both directions of this file: `evalAt` to state its
challenge-local checks, `eq_of_evalAt_eq` to extract from sufficiently many accepted
challenges.

/-- **Interpolation kernel**: two polynomials of `natDegree < N` that agree under `evalAt` at
`N` pairwise-distinct points of a domain are equal — the defect polynomial has more roots
than its degree, so it vanishes, and injectivity of `φF` reflects equality back to `R[X]`.
This is what makes point-checking a transported polynomial identity sound: `N` accepted
evaluations pin down a degree-`< N` object exactly. -/
