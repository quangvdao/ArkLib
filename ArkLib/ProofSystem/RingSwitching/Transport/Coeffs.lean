# Degree-bounded coefficient transport through a ring embedding

The multivariate leg of the claim-transport layer (see the folder umbrella
`ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Transport.lean`): reinterpret a multivariate polynomial
with coefficients in a base ring `R` as one over a target carrier `T`, without changing its
shape.

* `embedCoeffs φ : R⦃≤ d⦄[X σ] → T⦃≤ d⦄[X σ]` — component-wise coefficient transport along a
  ring hom `φ : R →+* T`. The individual degree bound `d` is preserved for free
  (`MvPolynomial.map` never enlarges supports), so degree-bounded polynomial families —
  multilinears at `d = 1`, higher-degree sumcheck round polynomials at larger `d` — stay in
  their class under transport.
* `embedCoeffs_eval` — transport commutes with evaluation: evaluating the transported
  polynomial at transported points computes the transported evaluation. This is the
  multivariate analogue of `evalAt_apply` and the identity that lets a verifier interpret a
  base-ring polynomial inside the carrier where its checks run.

The univariate leg — evaluation through an embedding and the interpolation kernel — is the
sibling file `Eval.lean`. In this folder, `Packing`
(`RingSwitching/Packing/`) consumes the multilinear case `d = 1` to embed the packed
polynomial into its pack/trace carrier.
