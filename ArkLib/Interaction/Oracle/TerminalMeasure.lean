# Terminal observations with explicit runtime faults

The VCVio completion keeps an outer `none` for execution missing mass. `observe` collapses that
case only after the caller names a fault. Acceptance and rejection retain exactly their original
mass; the new fault may coincide with a returned model fault, in which case their masses combine.
