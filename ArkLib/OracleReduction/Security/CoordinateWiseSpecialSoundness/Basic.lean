  # Coordinate-Wise Special Soundness (CWSS) — the notion

  This file defines **coordinate-wise special soundness** for (oracle) reductions, following
  [FMN24] (*Lattice-Based Polynomial Commitments*, who introduce the notion) and [NOZ26] (*Hachi*,
  Definition 3, the multi-round form we target).

  Coordinate-wise special soundness generalizes `k`-special soundness. In `k`-special soundness one
  extracts a witness from a tree of accepting transcripts in which, at each challenge round, there
  are `k` children with pairwise distinct challenges. In coordinate-wise special soundness the
  challenge of round `i` is a *vector* `Sᵢ^{ℓᵢ}`, and the children challenges form a structured set
  `SS(Sᵢ, ℓᵢ, kᵢ)`: a "central" challenge vector together with, for every coordinate, `kᵢ-1` sibling
  vectors that differ from the central one *only in that coordinate*. The arity at round `i` is
  therefore `ℓᵢ·(kᵢ-1)+1`.

  ## What is defined here

  1. The combinatorics of `SS(S, ℓ, k)`: `CoordEq` (the relation `≡ᵢ`) and `IsSpecialSoundFamily`.
  2. A `CWSSStructure`, packaging intrinsically valid per-round coordinate decompositions
     `Challenge i ≃ Sᵢ^{ℓᵢ}` and soundness parameters `kᵢ`.
  3. `CWSSStructure.toShape`: the generic challenge-tree shape whose node predicate is the CWSS
     `SS(Sᵢ, ℓᵢ, kᵢ)` condition.
  4. `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith` / `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSound`: a tree-based
     extractor turns any structured accepting tree, together with a valid witnessing of its leaves
     (`ChallengeTree.LeafWitnesses.IsValid`), into a valid input witness — the IOR form of [NOZ26]
     Def. 3, named and existentially closed.
  5. `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape`: the escape-threaded variant, for reductions
     whose extraction may instead break a cryptographic assumption. The escape is an event on
     `(stmtIn, tree)` (`ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent`) entering as a disjunct of the conclusion, so
     relations and extractors stay plain and plain certificates lift losslessly
     (`coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith.withEscape`).

  Every notion here is its generic counterpart in `Security.TranscriptTree` at the shape
  `D.toShape`, so the generic theory — the shape transports, the classical closer, the composition
  theorems — applies at the CWSS shape with no separate proof.

  Plain `(k)`-special soundness is the `ℓᵢ = 1` case (`Verifier.specialSound` in
  `Security.SpecialSoundness`).

/-! ## The combinatorial structure `SS(S, ℓ, k)`

These definitions are pure combinatorics on vectors in `S^ℓ ≃ (Fin ℓ → S)`, independent of any
protocol. They capture exactly the set `SS(S, ℓ, k)` from [FMN24] / [NOZ26].
-/

variable {S : Type*}

/-- The relation `x ≡ᵢ y`: the coordinate-vectors `x` and `y` agree in every coordinate except the
  `i`-th, where they differ. For `ℓ = 1` this is just `x 0 ≠ y 0`. -/
def CoordEq {ℓ : ℕ} (i : Fin ℓ) (x y : Fin ℓ → S) : Prop :=
  x i ≠ y i ∧ ∀ j, j ≠ i → x j = y j

/-- `≡ᵢ` is decidable over a decidable alphabet: finitely many coordinates, each compared by
`DecidableEq`. This is what lets the star-center search (`CoordinateWise.SingleRound.central` /
`sib`) run rather than choose classically, hence what keeps tree extractors executable. -/
instance instDecidableCoordEq [DecidableEq S] {ℓ : ℕ} (i : Fin ℓ) (x y : Fin ℓ → S) :
    Decidable (CoordEq i x y) := by unfold CoordEq; infer_instance

/-- A family of `ℓ·(k-1)+1` coordinate-vectors `c` is **coordinate-wise special sound**, i.e. lies
  in `SS(S, ℓ, k)`, if

  - the `ℓ·(k-1)+1` vectors are pairwise distinct (`Function.Injective c`), and
  - there is a *central* index `e` such that for every coordinate `i ∈ Fin ℓ` there are `k-1` other
    indices whose vectors agree with `c e` off coordinate `i` (and differ on it).

  This is the precise rendering of the set `SS(S, ℓ, k)` from [FMN24] Def. 2.9 / [NOZ26] §2.3.
  In the paper `SS(S, ℓ, k)` is a *set* `{x₁, …, x_K}` of `K := ℓ·(k-1)+1` **distinct** vectors; the
  `Function.Injective c` clause is what encodes that distinctness. It is load-bearing: since the
  `k-1` siblings of a coordinate `i` agree with `c e` off coordinate `i`, distinctness of the
  vectors forces them to be pairwise distinct *in coordinate `i`*, giving the `k` distinct values
  per coordinate that extraction relies on. (Without it, the siblings could collapse to a single
  value, leaving only `2` distinct values in a coordinate.) The branching arity `ℓ·(k-1)+1` is
  built into the index type. -/

      e ∉ J ∧ J.card = k - 1 ∧ ∀ j ∈ J, CoordEq i (c e) (c j)

/-- For `ℓ = 1`, coordinate-wise special soundness is ordinary `k`-special soundness: the challenge
  values are distinct, and there is a central vector together with `k - 1` siblings differing in the
  single coordinate — i.e. `k` pairwise-distinct challenge values. -/

  exactly injectivity of the `k` challenge vectors: a central vector together with `k-1` siblings
  differing in the unique coordinate is just `k` pairwise-distinct values. This is the cleaner
  `ℓ = 1` characterization underlying the bridge to plain `k`-special soundness. -/
