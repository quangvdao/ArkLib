# Composable coordinate-wise-special-sound reductions (`CWSSPackage`)

A `CWSSPackage` bundles a verifier with everything needed to state and reuse its coordinate-wise
special soundness (CWSS): the challenge structure `struct`, the input/output relations
`relIn`/`relOut`, a purity witness `isPure` carrying its verdict function as *data*, the named
extraction algorithm `extractor`, and the CWSS certificate `isCWSS`, all with respect to a fixed
sampling `(init, impl)`.

The point is composition. `CWSSPackage.append` — written with the infix `▷` — chains two
packages along a matching seam (`L₁.relOut = L₂.relIn`, discharged by `rfl`): it appends the
verifiers (`Verifier.append`), appends the structures (`CWSSStructure.append`), composes the purity
data (`Verifier.PureForm.append`), composes the extractors (`Extractor.TreeBased.append`, seamed by
the left verifier's verdict function `L₁.isPure.verify`), and threads the two certificates through
`Verifier.append_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith`. Because purity is a package field, the
composed package is itself pure and can be a left factor again, so a multi-step reduction reads as a
single pleasant chain:

```
def chain := head ▷ middle ▷ tail
theorem chain_cwss := chain.isCWSS
```

Each protocol component exports its own package next to its CWSS theorem; the composition site only
imports and chains them. The universal `▷` is a single elaborator defined in `Escape.lean` (it
dispatches over all four package kinds — pure, guarded, escape-aware, or both); it is `scoped` in
`CoordinateWise`, so `open scoped CoordinateWise` (or `open CoordinateWise`) activates it.

Purity is carried **as data** (`Verifier.PureForm`, not the `Verifier.IsPure` class), and that is
what keeps the composed extractor computable: the seam statement is `L₁.isPure.verify`, read off the
field rather than chosen out of the `IsPure` existential.

/-- A **bundled coordinate-wise-special-sound reduction**: a verifier together with its CWSS
structure, input/output relations, a purity witness, the **named extraction algorithm** `extractor`,
and the certificate `isCWSS` that this extractor witnesses CWSS, all with respect to a fixed
sampling `(init, impl)`. Compose packages with `CWSSPackage.append` / the infix `▷`.

Carrying the extractor as a *field* (rather than existentially inside the certificate) means a
composed chain exposes an actual end-to-end extractor — `chain.extractor` — which is what a later
knowledge-error accounting must run, and what makes the certificate content-bearing (see
`Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith`). The existential form remains available as `L.isCWSS.toCWSS`.

Purity is a field of *data* (`verifier.PureForm`, not the `Verifier.IsPure` class), which is what
keeps the composed `extractor` computable: `append` must run the right factor at the statement the
left verifier outputs at the seam, and reading that verdict off the class would cost
`Classical.choice`. `Verifier.PureForm.isPure` forgets back whenever the class is what a caller
wants. -/

field is *data* of both factors: the extractors compose by `Extractor.TreeBased.append` at the
seam verdict `L₁.isPure.verify`, and the purity witnesses by `Verifier.PureForm.append`. The

closure), since the composed extractor contains `E₂`. -/
