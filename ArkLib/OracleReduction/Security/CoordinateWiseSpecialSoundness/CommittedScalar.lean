  # Committed scalar phase (generic commit-then-challenge CWSS shell)

  A recurring two-round shape: the prover **commits** to an opening, the verifier sends one
  **scalar challenge**, and the output statement retains both values. This file owns that shape
  once — protocol, anchored relation, escape event, and the extraction argument — so that each
  instantiation supplies only its challenge-local predicate and one recovery theorem.

  This is deliberately *not* a ring-switching module. It is the protocol/security seam that
  quotient-evaluation ring switches such as [HMZ25] (Hachi [NOZ26] Figure 4 / Lemma 9) happen to
  have, but nothing here mentions rings, polynomials, or packing: the ingredients are a
  `BindingCommitment` and a `checkAt` predicate. The basis-packing ring switch of DP24 and Hachi §3
  is a different construction (`ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Packing/`); with this file it shares the
  `ScalarRound.pSpecScalar` wire format (this file's verifier is the check-free case of the
  check-then-update round shape on that wire — `ProofSystem/RingSwitching/RoundVerifiers.lean`).

  ## Where the binding break lives

  Commitments of interest here are only binding on **short** openings, so a committed scalar phase
  cannot promise a `relIn`-witness unconditionally: an adversary who breaks the commitment gets to
  choose the branch openings. In this development that failure is an **escape event** on the
  transcript tree (`ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent`), never a value the extractor returns. Concretely
  `escLocal` says *"two of the tree's branch openings are a short collision of the round-0
  commitment"*, and the certificate `coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape` concludes
  `escEvent stmt tree ∨ extraction succeeds on every valid leaf witnessing`.

  Making this an event rather than an extractor output is forced: `BindingCommitment.Collision` is
  nonempty for every compressing commitment, so a certificate whose escape branch were an
  extractor *output* would be dischargeable by a constant function and carry no content. Events on
  `(stmt, tree)` are the only objects a certificate author cannot choose. Per the
  `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent` contract, `escLocal` reads only the commitment and the branch
  responses; the ambient `escEventScalar` pins those responses to the **output** relation, which is
  what keeps the event tight.

  ## Contents

  * `BindingCommitment W Short` — a deterministic commitment together with the shortness regime its
    binding guarantee is restricted to, plus its **short-collision set**
    `BindingCommitment.Collision` (the hardness target the escape event points at).
  * `CommittedScalar.Statement`, `CommittedScalar.rel` — the output statement
    `Stmt × TCom × Challenge` and the anchored relation (commitment consistency + `checkAt` +
    `Short`).
  * `CommittedScalar.verifier` / `CommittedScalar.prover` — the pure statement-extending verifier
    and the honest prover shell (the commitment is derived from the output opening by construction).
  * `CommittedScalar.mkWitness` / `CommittedScalar.escLocal` — the plain per-family assembler and
    the local escape event; `CommittedScalar.escEvent` / `CommittedScalar.treeExtractor` are their
    tree-level forms, both via `ScalarRound`.
  * `CommittedScalar.mkWitness_mem` — the disjunctive correctness theorem, parameterized by the
    single instance-specific `recover` hypothesis (one common short opening satisfying `checkAt` at
    `k` pairwise-distinct challenges recovers the input relation).
  * `CommittedScalar.verifierPureForm` — the verifier's purity as data, which the package carries
    so that composition reads the seam statement without choice.
  * `CommittedScalar.coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape` / `CommittedScalar.package` — the
    generic certificate at `scalarStructure k` and its `EscapeCWSSPackage` bundle, ready for `▷`
    composition against packages of any of the four kinds.

  ## Consumers

  * The generic HMZ25 quotient-evaluation lift (`ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Lift/Reduction.lean`),
    and through it Hachi's ring switch (`Commitments/Functional/Hachi/RingSwitch/Reduction.lean`)
    at `k = 2d`.

/-- A deterministic commitment together with the shortness regime `Short` its binding guarantee is
restricted to.

Lemma-9-style extraction needs nothing but the commitment map itself: weak binding enters as the

`Collision` below. Exact binding is the degenerate case where `Collision` is empty. -/

For an Ajtai-style commitment an element of this set is a Module-SIS solution for the fixed key
([NOZ26] Lemma 7), so it is the hardness target a committed scalar phase's escape event points at.
Taking `Short` from the structure's own index keeps an event from being stated at a mismatched
shortness regime. Note this set is nonempty for every compressing commitment, which is exactly why
exhibiting a member has to be an *event on the transcript tree* rather than an extractor output. -/

branch `0` is soundness-irrelevant; on families that do share one, every branch gives the same

nor acceptance, nor the verifier, nor the sampling. It reads only `t` and the branch responses,

`esc` field. Escape-free neighbours compose against it for free through the universal `▷`

`com` the event simply never fires. -/

/-! ## Completeness of a committed scalar phase

The honest counterpart of `coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape`, owned here for the same reason:
the execution of the two-round commit-then-challenge shape is protocol-independent, so an
instantiation should supply only the two facts about its own `computeW` that the *relation*
`rel K checkAt` asks for — the challenge-local check at every challenge, and admissibility.

round-1 challenge index stays type-correct at the transparency `rw` uses. The `Challenge`

argument occurs, so without it the statement elaborates with an unassigned challenge type. -/

The two hypotheses are precisely the two conjuncts of `rel K checkAt` that are not true by
construction: `hcheck`, the challenge-local predicate at **every** challenge (which is why the error
is `0` and why no property of the challenge distribution is used), and `hshort`, admissibility of
the opening the honest prover computes. Commitment consistency is definitional — the prover shell
derives its round-0 message from `computeW`, so it cannot commit to anything else.
