  # Guarded verifiers and guarded CWSS composition (`GCWSSPackage`)

  **Skeleton** of coordinate-wise special soundness (CWSS) composition where the *left* factor may
  **reject at runtime**, as needed by the Hachi sumcheck ([NOZ26]); inventoried as *generic
  machinery* in `Commitments/Functional/Hachi/Composition.lean`.

  ## Why guarded verifiers

  The pure composition machinery (`Verifier.append_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith`,
  `CWSSPackage.append` = `▷`) requires the left verifier to be *pure*: its verdict is a
  deterministic total function of statement and transcript, with all acceptance conditions living
  in the output **relation**. This works whenever the data a check reads survives into the output
  statement (the `QuadEval` pattern). It fails exactly where a runtime check reads *sent or input*
  data that the downstream statement type **drops** — in Hachi:

  1. each sumcheck round's check `gᵢ(0) + gᵢ(1) = target` (the old target is dropped by the next
     round's statement) — [NOZ26] Figure 6;
  2. the final-evaluation check against the last sumcheck targets — [NOZ26] Figure 7 tail;
  3. the §4.5 recursion handoff's trace check (the next-iteration statement type is pinned to
     `QuadEvalStatement`, which cannot retain it).

  A **guarded** verifier `if check stmt tr then pure (out stmt tr) else failure` is the faithful
  model (`failure` is native: the verifier monad is `OptionT (OracleComp _)`). Its acceptance
  probability is `0` on the `failure` branch, so on an *accepting* tree every leaf has
  `check = true` — which is exactly the paper's "valid transcripts" premise, and which the
  guarded composition theorem below feeds to the left extraction.

  ## Contents

  * `Verifier.IsGuardedWith` / `Verifier.IsGuarded` — the guard predicate (`Bool`-valued check);
    purity is the `check := fun _ _ => true` special case
    (`IsGuarded.of_isPure`).
  * `Verifier.GuardedForm` — guardedness with its check and verdict map as **data** (the guarded
    mirror of `Verifier.PureForm`), with `GuardedForm.isGuarded` forgetting back to the class and
    `PureForm.toGuardedForm` the data form of `IsGuarded.of_isPure`. A guarded package carries this,
    since its composed escape event must *name* the left verdict map.
  * `Verifier.GuardedForm.append` — closure of guardedness **data** under `Verifier.append`:
    composite check `check₁ s tr.fst && check₂ (out₁ s tr.fst) tr.snd`, mirroring
    `Verifier.PureForm.append`; `Verifier.IsGuarded.append` is the forgetful corollary.
  * `Verifier.append_treeSpecialSoundWith_guardedLeft` / `…WithEscape_guardedLeft` and their CWSS
    wrappers `Verifier.append_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith_of_guardedLeft` / `…WithEscape…` — the
    guarded binary appends at the witness-only extractor, **proved**. The guarded seam lemmas they
    run on (`append_run_guardedLeft`, `append_run_outputs_guardedLeft`,
    `outputs_guarded_subsingleton`, `guarded_accepting_of_mem`, `guarded_verdict_mem_outputs`) live
    here too, since they mention `IsGuardedWith`.
  * `GCWSSPackage` — the guarded analogue of `CWSSPackage` (`isPure` ↝ `isGuarded`, at the data
    form), with `CWSSPackage.toGuarded`, the composition `GCWSSPackage.append` = infix `▷` (explicit
    synonym `▷ᵍ`), and the two mixed appends `CWSSPackage.appendGuarded` /
    `GCWSSPackage.appendPure`.

  As everywhere in the CWSS development, composition here is **binary only**: the Hachi composition
  builds its guarded loop by *recursion over the binary guarded append*
  (`ArkLib/Commitments/Functional/Hachi/Sumcheck/Rounds.lean`), so no `n`-ary guarded variant is
  needed (nor does an `n`-ary CWSS composition exist to mirror).

/-! ### The guarded seam at the witness-only extractor

Five lemmas replay the pure seam of `Composition.lean` for a guarded left factor, each conditioned
on the guard passing: `append_run_guardedLeft` is `append_run_pure_left` behind an `if`,
`append_run_outputs_guardedLeft` and `guarded_verdict_mem_outputs` are its `Verifier.Outputs`-level
consequences, `outputs_guarded_subsingleton` pins the output set (the rejecting branch reaches no
statement at all), and `guarded_accepting_of_mem` is `pure_accepting_of_mem` where the check passes.

With those, the guarded composition theorems are the pure skeleton with **one move in front**: on an
accepting composed tree every prefix guard must already pass (`hcheck`), learned by exhibiting one
suffix leaf — which is what `ChallengeTree.somePath` supplies and what the `harity₂` hypothesis
buys. `Verifier.not_accepting_of_failure` then refutes the rejecting branch. -/

/-! ## The guarded package

`GCWSSPackage` is `CWSSPackage` with the purity field relaxed to guardedness — and, like it, at the
*data* form: `isGuarded : verifier.GuardedForm`. The composed extractor and escape event both name
the left verdict map, which is read off that field as `L₁.isGuarded.out`.

A pure `CWSSPackage` enters the guarded world losslessly (`CWSSPackage.toGuarded`: the guard is the
trivially-true check and the certificate is unchanged). The mixed appends below insert this lift
automatically, so guarded packages need only be *defined* for the subprotocols whose checks
genuinely reject at runtime. Together with the escape-lifting appends in `Escape.lean`, every
ordered pair of package kinds (escape? × guarded?) composes at its join through the universal `▷`
elaborator defined in `Escape.lean`: two pure packages compose pure (staying on the pure append
theorem), while a single guarded factor moves the composite — visibly in its type — onto the guarded
append theorem. -/
