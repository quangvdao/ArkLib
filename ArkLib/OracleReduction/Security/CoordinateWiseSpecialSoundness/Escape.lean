  # Escape-aware CWSS packages and the package lattice

  Some reductions cannot always extract a witness: instead their extraction exhibits a
  cryptographic **escape**, e.g. a binding break of a commitment introduced mid-chain (Hachi's
  `w̃`-commitment of Figure 4, whose collision is a Module-SIS solution by weak binding,
  [NOZ26] Remark 2 / Lemma 7). An escape is an **event on the observable data** `(stmtIn, tree)`
  (`ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent`) entering the certificate as a disjunct of its conclusion:

  ```
  ∀ stmt tree, IsStructured → IsAccepting → esc stmt tree ∨ (stmt, Ext stmt tree) ∈ relIn
  ```

  Relations, witness types and extractors therefore stay plain; `esc` is the only escape-specific
  field a package carries. Since `esc` never mentions the extractor, no choice of extractor can
  discharge a certificate vacuously — the certificate is exactly as strong as its event is honest.
  `esc` is a **trusted specification**, on the same footing as `relIn`/`relOut`; its contract is
  stated once, on `ProtocolSpec.ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent`. Read it before writing an event.

  Packages carry their extraction algorithm as an explicit `extractor` field, so a composed chain
  exposes an actual end-to-end extractor `chain.extractor` — the algorithm a later knowledge-error
  accounting must run against the escape probability.

  ## The package lattice

  `CWSSPackage`, `EscapeCWSSPackage`, `GCWSSPackage`, `EscapeGCWSSPackage` form the 2×2 lattice
  escape? × guarded?, ordered by two **lossless** lifts: `toEscape` (at the never-firing event
  `fun _ _ => False`, so extractor and certificate are unchanged) and `toGuarded` (at the
  trivially-true check). A package is declared in the weakest corner it honestly lives in, and
  every ordered pair composes at the join through the universal `▷` — one scoped elaborator
  dispatching on the factors' package kinds (`▷ᵍ`, `▷ₑ`, `▷ₑᵍ` remain as explicit synonyms).

  Composition identifies only the relation seam `hRel`: escape events are combined by
  `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent.append`, so factors tracking breaks of entirely different assumptions
  compose freely. Two pure packages compose on the pure append theorem; a genuinely guarded factor
  moves the composite — visibly in its type — onto the guarded one. A composed event reads the left
  verdict map off `L₁.isPure.verify` / `L₁.isGuarded.out`, i.e. off *data*, which is what keeps a
  composed chain's extractor computable.

/-! ## The escape-aware packages

The top half of the lattice: `EscapeCWSSPackage` and `EscapeGCWSSPackage` are `CWSSPackage` /
`GCWSSPackage` with one extra field, the escape event `esc`. `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent.append`
takes the left verdict map as its index, and the packages carry that map as *data*, so a composed
`esc` reads `L₁.isPure.verify` (resp. `L₁.isGuarded.out`) rather than laundering it out of a `Prop`
with `Classical.choice`. -/

/-! ### The universal append `▷`

A single (scoped) elaborator rather than sixteen overloaded notations: `L₁ ▷ L₂` elaborates both
factors once, reads the head constant of their types to determine the package kinds, and applies
the unique append that composes them at their join. Overloaded-notation `choice` nodes would
re-elaborate nested alternatives once per outer candidate — exponential in chain length, and a
five-link Hachi chain already exhausts the heartbeat budget — whereas this dispatch is linear.
The kind-marked infixes `▷ₑ`, `▷ᵍ`, `▷ₑᵍ` remain as single-target explicit synonyms. -/
