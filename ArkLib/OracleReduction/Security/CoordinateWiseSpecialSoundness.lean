  # Coordinate-Wise Special Soundness (CWSS)

  Re-exports the coordinate-wise special-soundness development of [FMN24] / [NOZ26]. CWSS is built
  as one instance of the protocol-generic, shape-based tree-soundness machinery in
  `Security.TranscriptTree`:

  * `Basic` — the notion: the `SS(S, ℓ, k)` combinatorics (`CoordEq`, `IsSpecialSoundFamily`), the
    intrinsic `CWSSStructure` (per-round challenge decomposition with built-in valid soundness
    parameters) and its induced `ChallengeTreeShape` (`CWSSStructure.toShape`), the CWSS predicate
    `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith` / `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSound` obtained by
    instantiating the shape-generic core `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith`
    (`Security.TranscriptTree`) at `D.toShape`, and its escape-threaded twin
    `Verifier.coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape`.
  * `Composition` — transport of CWSS structures across protocol append (`CWSSStructure.append`),
    its agreement with the generic appended shape (`toShape_append`), the pure-verifier acceptance
    bridge (`Verifier.pure_accepting_of_mem` / `mem_of_pure_accepting`), the seam lemma
    `Verifier.append_run_outputs`, and preservation of CWSS under binary verifier append
    (`Verifier.append_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith` and `…WithEscape`) as thin wrappers over the
    generic `Verifier.append_treeSpecialSoundWith` / `append_treeSpecialSoundWithEscape`. The
    composed extractor is `Extractor.TreeBased.append`, seamed by the left verifier's verdict
    function passed as data.
  * `NoChallenge` — the degenerate bridge for protocols with no challenge rounds
    (`IsEmpty pSpec.ChallengeIdx`): tree special soundness collapses to a transcript-level extractor
    (`Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith_of_isEmpty_challengeIdx`).

  **Composition is deliberately binary**: multi-step chains are built by recursion over the binary
  append (the `CoordinateWise` packages' `▷`, in `CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness/Escape.lean`),
  which keeps the composed extractor a nameable function instead of a transport across an `n`-ary
  shape identity. The protocol-level `ProtocolSpec.seqCompose` is unaffected.

  Plain `(k)`-special soundness is the `ℓᵢ = 1` instance (`CWSSStructure.ofSpecialSound`); see also
  `Security.SpecialSoundness`.
