  # Trees of transcripts — core definitions

  This file defines `ChallengeTree`, the *tree of transcripts* of a public-coin protocol, together
  with the generic structural data attached to it. The tree branches only at challenge rounds: a
  message round has a single child (the prover's message), a challenge round has one child per
  branch (each labelled by the verifier's challenge), and every root-to-leaf path reads off a full
  transcript. Two paths that share their challenges up to a round share the same prefix, so the tree
  is exactly the family of transcripts a forking extractor produces and that special-soundness
  notions extract a witness from.

  Composing trees along sequential protocol composition is handled in `TranscriptTree.Composition`.

  ## Representation

  `ChallengeTree pSpec arity m` is the tree over the remaining rounds `m, …, n-1`, indexed by the
  current round `m : Fin (n + 1)`; a full tree is the `m = 0` case. Its three constructors are
  `leaf` (all rounds processed), `msgNode` (a message round, one child), and `chalNode` (a challenge
  round, `arity i` children). A challenge node stores the sibling labels and the child subtrees as
  two separate functions rather than one into a product, since a product would nest the recursive
  occurrence under `Prod`, which the kernel rejects. `LeafPath.transcript` reads a `FullTranscript`
  off a path, `transcripts` lists all leaf transcripts, and the membership lemmas identify
  "transcript on some path" with "transcript in the list".

  ## Decoupling structure from the soundness relation

  `ChallengeTree` does not fix what the sibling challenges at a node must satisfy. That condition is
  supplied as a `ChallengeTreeShape` — a branching `arity` and a `nodeOk` predicate on each round's
  siblings — and `ChallengeTree.IsStructured S` asserts every challenge node satisfies `S.nodeOk`. A
  concrete notion is then a choice of shape: pairwise-distinct siblings for plain special soundness,
  a coordinate-structured condition for CWSS (`CWSSStructure.toShape`). This keeps the composition
  results in `TranscriptTree.Composition` shape-generic, hence proved once for all notions.

  ## Main definitions

  - `ChallengeTree` — the inductive tree, branching only at challenge rounds.
  - `ChallengeTreeShape` / `ChallengeTree.IsStructured` — the shape (arity + `nodeOk`) and the
    predicate that every challenge node satisfies it.
  - `LeafPath`, `LeafPath.transcript` / `fullTranscript`, `transcripts` / `fullTranscripts` — the
    root-to-leaf paths, the transcript each selects, the list of all leaf transcripts, and their
    membership correspondence (`mem_fullTranscripts`, `exists_of_mem_fullTranscripts`).
  - `ChallengeTree.onlyPath` — the unique root-to-leaf path of a challenge-free tree, read off the
    tree by structural recursion — and `ChallengeTree.somePath`, its positive-arity analogue: *some*
    leaf path of any tree that branches at all.
  - `ChallengeTree.IsAccepting` — the verifier accepts every root-to-leaf transcript into the output
    language with probability one.
  - `Verifier.Outputs` — the statements the verifier *can* output on a transcript under the fixed
    sampling, with the acceptance bridges (`mem_language_of_mem_outputs`,
    `outputs_nonempty_of_isAccepting`) and the pure-verifier pin-down (`outputs_pure_subsingleton`,
    `pure_verdict_mem_outputs`). `support_init_nonempty_of_prob_one` and
    `not_accepting_of_failure` read the same acceptance fact off a single transcript.
  - `ChallengeTree.LeafWitnesses` / `LeafWitnesses.IsValid` — one candidate *output* witness per
    leaf, and what makes such a witnessing honest: every answer certifies, in `relOut`, some
    statement the verifier can output at that leaf. At a pure verifier this collapses to per-verdict
    witnessing (`LeafWitnesses.isValid_iff_pure`).
  - `Extractor.TreeBased` — the tree-consuming extractor shared by all tree-based notions: it
    consumes the tree *and* a leaf witnessing, and returns `Option WitIn`.
  - `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith` / `Verifier.treeSpecialSound` — the shape-generic
    tree-soundness predicate (named and existential): on every `S`-structured accepting tree, the
    extractor succeeds on every valid witnessing. Plain special soundness
    (`Security.SpecialSoundness`) and coordinate-wise special soundness
    (`Security.CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness`) are both instances, for different shapes.
  - `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent` / `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWithEscape` — the escape-threaded
    variant, for reductions whose extraction may instead break a cryptographic assumption: the
    conclusion is `esc stmtIn tree ∨ extraction succeeds`. The plain notion is the never-firing
    event (`treeSpecialSoundWithEscape_false_iff`), and every plain certificate lifts losslessly
    (`Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith.withEscape`).
  - `ChallengeTree.canonWitnesses` / `canonWitnesses_isValid` and
    `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith.mem_relIn_of_isAccepting` — the closer: acceptance alone supplies
    a valid witnessing, so the validity premise is never an obstruction and a certificate can still
    be read unconditionally.

  ## Caveat

  The branching arity is fixed by the round index, not the path, so path-dependent branching is not
  supported. This matches the source notions and could be relaxed later.

namespace ProtocolSpec

variable {n : ℕ}

/-- A **tree of transcripts** for a protocol `pSpec`, branching only at challenge rounds.

The tree is indexed by the current round `m : Fin (n + 1)` (the rounds `m, m+1, …, n-1` are still to
come). Each challenge round `i` branches into `arity i` children. A `ChallengeTree pSpec arity 0`
(rooted at round `0`) describes a full tree of transcripts; reading the messages and challenges
along each root-to-leaf path recovers the corresponding `FullTranscript pSpec` (see
`ChallengeTree.transcripts`).

The challenge labels and subtrees of a challenge node are kept as two separate functions (rather
than a single function into a product) so that the recursive occurrence is not nested under `Prod`,
which the kernel forbids.

Note: The challenge arity is determined by the round index, not the path. So path-dependent
branching (e.g. "branch into 2 if the first challenge is `0`, branch into 3 if it's `1`") is not
currently supported. This may be generalized in the future, but keeps the current design simple
enough to follow the CWSS paper proofs.

This is what makes a subtree's transcript set inhabited, which matters as soon as verifiers are

subtree below it and contradict acceptance there. For pure verifiers the fact is never needed,
which is why it appears only now. Positivity is free for every coordinate-wise structure, whose

/-- The **unique root-to-leaf path** of a challenge-free tree (`IsEmpty pSpec.ChallengeIdx`).

With no challenge rounds a tree cannot contain a `chalNode`, so it is a single chain of message
nodes ending in a leaf: there is no branch to choose, and the path is read off the tree by plain
structural recursion. In particular it is **computable**, which is what the zero-challenge
special-soundness bridges in `Security.CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness.NoChallenge` build their
extractors on. The transcript it selects, `tree.onlyPath.fullTranscript`, is the tree's unique full
transcript and lies in `tree.fullTranscripts` by `LeafPath.mem_fullTranscripts`. -/

/-- **Some** root-to-leaf path of a tree whose branching is everywhere positive: take the first
branch at each challenge node.

Where `onlyPath` needs the tree to be challenge-free, this needs only `0 < arity i` — enough to
know a challenge node *has* a child. It is the probe of the guarded composition theorems: a guarded
left factor learns that its check passes on a prefix transcript only by exhibiting *some* suffix
leaf beneath it, and a witness of "the suffix tree is inhabited" is exactly this path. Like
`onlyPath` it is plain structural recursion, hence computable. -/

section EscapeEvent

/-- An **escape event**: a statement-indexed predicate on full challenge trees, the
  hypothesis-side home of cryptographic escapes (e.g. "the openings derived from this tree collide
  under the fixed commitment key — a Module-SIS solution"). A tree-special-soundness certificate
  concludes `esc stmt tree ∨ extraction succeeds`, so an escape is an event on the *observable
  data*, never an output the extractor can fabricate.

  An escape event is a **trusted specification**, on the same footing as a package's
  `relIn`/`relOut`: nothing in the framework checks it. Two conditions every instance must satisfy,
  reviewed by reading its definition:

  - **hardness-tied and unconditional**: every `(stmt, tree)` satisfying the event must yield a
    break of the ambient assumption, checked against protocol parameters fixed outside the
    statement — at *every* pair, including statements no honest execution produces (composed
    events evaluate factor events at adversarially controllable intermediate statements);
  - **tree-determined**: the event may only constrain values computed from `(stmt, tree)`. It must
    not mention the verifier, the sampling `(init, impl)`, the *input* relation `relIn`, an
    extractor, or acceptance, since those smuggle in tautologies (e.g.
    `fun s t => (s, Ext s t) ∉ relIn` makes any certificate at `Ext` vacuous). Constraining the
    tree's per-branch responses by the *output* relation is fine and desirable — see below.

  Beyond honesty, aim for a **tight** event: one that fires only where extraction genuinely fails.
  Tightness is not enforced; a wider event just yields a weaker certificate, and a statement-only
  event like "some collision of this commitment exists" is honest yet worthless because it fires
  almost everywhere. Pinning the tree's per-branch responses to `relOut` (as
  `CoordinateWise.SingleRound.escEvent` does) is the standard way to get tightness.

  The trivial event `fun _ _ => False` is the escape-free degeneration (lossless: see
  `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith.withEscape`). -/

/-! ## The verifier's reachable output statements

A leaf witnessing (below) certifies its witnesses *at statements the verifier can actually output*
on that leaf's transcript. `Verifier.Outputs` is that set, read off the fixed sampling
`(init, impl)`; the lemmas here relate it to `IsAccepting` (on an accepting tree the set is nonempty
and contained in the output language) and pin it down at a pure verifier (there it is the singleton
of the verdict, as soon as the sampling can produce a seed). -/

/-! ## Tree special soundness at the witness-only extractor

The notion the library states, at `Extractor.TreeBased`: on every structured accepting tree,
extraction succeeds *on every valid leaf witnessing*. One clause — the honesty discipline is the
validity premise's reachability condition (`ChallengeTree.LeafWitnesses.IsValid`), not a separate
conjunct, and there is no claim map for a certificate to be honest about, because the extractor
attributes no statements.

The premise is never an obstruction: the canonical witnessing is valid on every accepting tree
(`ChallengeTree.canonWitnesses_isValid`), so a certificate can still be read unconditionally
(`treeSpecialSoundWith.mem_relIn_of_isAccepting`). -/

/-- A named tree-based extractor `Ext` **witnesses tree special soundness** of a verifier with
  respect to a generic challenge-tree shape `S`, an input relation `relIn` and an output relation
  `relOut`: for every input statement `stmtIn` and every tree of transcripts that is

  - `S`-structured (its sibling challenges satisfy the shape's `nodeOk` predicate), and
  - accepting (the verifier accepts every root-to-leaf transcript, landing in `relOut.language`),

  and for every **valid** leaf witnessing `o` of that tree
  (`ChallengeTree.LeafWitnesses.IsValid` — each of its witnesses certifies, in `relOut`, some
  statement the verifier can output at that leaf), the extractor succeeds: `Ext stmtIn tree o` is
  `some w` with `(stmtIn, w) ∈ relIn`.

  This named form is the **content-bearing** statement of special soundness: it pins the extraction
  *algorithm*, so it asserts something about the actual output of `Ext`. Its existential closure is
  `Verifier.treeSpecialSound` — prefer the named form in advertised protocol statements, since a
  chain of named certificates exposes a runnable end-to-end extractor (`chain.extractor`), which is
  what a later knowledge-error accounting has to run. Reductions whose extraction may instead break
  a cryptographic assumption use `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWithEscape` below. -/

/-- **Escape-threaded tree special soundness, named form.** `Verifier.treeSpecialSoundWith` with an
  escape-event disjunct: on every structured accepting tree, either the tree exhibits the escape
  event `esc` (a trusted spec — see `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent`) or extraction succeeds on every
  valid leaf witnessing. An escaping factor owes no witness, and the disjunction is decided before
  any witnessing is seen.

  **The quantifier order is deliberate: do not commute it.** The disjunction sits *outside* the
  witnessing quantifier — `esc ∨ ∀ o valid, …`, not `∀ o valid, esc ∨ …`. The two are not
  interchangeable: this form is strictly stronger, and it is what makes the escape decision
  independent of the supplied witnessing, so an escape cannot be conjured by feeding the reduction
  an awkward set of output witnesses. The composition proofs depend on it —
  `append_treeSpecialSoundWithEscape_guardedLeft` resolves both factors' escape disjuncts *before*
  it introduces a witnessing (`refine Or.inr fun o hvalid => ?_`), which is only possible at this
  order — and so does the unconditioned closer
  `treeSpecialSoundWithEscape.escape_or_mem_relIn_of_isAccepting`, which passes the escape disjunct
  through untouched. A later "simplification" pushing the `∨` inside the `∀` would silently weaken
  every certificate in the chain. -/

  it is the right migration receipt — it is the old statement, derived — and not a reason to prefer
  it: for a reduction the `∀ o valid` form is the stronger and more useful statement, since it is
  what composes into a runnable end-to-end extractor. -/
