# `Polynomial.degreeLT` boundary facts

Lemmas about `Polynomial.degreeLT R n` (the submodule of polynomials of degree `< n`) at
the boundary `n = 0`, where it collapses to the zero submodule.

These are reusable for any construction that maps `degreeLT` through a linear map — e.g.
Reed-Solomon codes (`ReedSolomon.code α n = (degreeLT F n).map (evalOnPoints α)`), folded
RS codes, and similar code families. Candidate for upstream PR to Mathlib.
