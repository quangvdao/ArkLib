# Finite forward Hasse--Taylor truncations

This file packages the first `m` coefficients of Mathlib's forward Taylor shift `p(X + a)` as an
explicit polynomial.  Unlike `Polynomial.sum_taylor_eq`, which reconstructs `p` after shifting
back by `a`, this API stays in the displacement variable `X`.  It is intended for consumers that
need a finite jet plus a remainder divisible by `X ^ m`.

Construction and coefficient lemmas require only a semiring.  Subtraction, the remainder, and its
canonical quotient by the monic polynomial `X ^ m` are isolated in the `Ring` section.
