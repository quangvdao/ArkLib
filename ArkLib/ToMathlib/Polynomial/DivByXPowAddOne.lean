# Division by `X ^ d + 1` in the low-degree range

Dividing a polynomial of degree `< 2 d` by `X ^ d + 1` needs no algorithm: writing
`p = A + X ^ d · B` with `deg A, deg B < d`, the identity `p = (X ^ d + 1) · B + (A - B)` already
exhibits quotient and remainder, because `deg (A - B) < d = deg (X ^ d + 1)`. Hence the quotient is
just the **upper half of the coefficients**, shifted down by `d`:

`(p /ₘ (X ^ d + 1)).coeff k = p.coeff (d + k)`.

This is the concrete replacement for a general theory of coefficient growth under polynomial
division: in the power-of-two cyclotomic setting (`φ = X ^ d + 1`, `d = 2 ^ α`) every quotient of a
degree-`< 2 d` polynomial is *coefficientwise a subsequence of the dividend*, so any coefficient
bound on the dividend transfers verbatim to the quotient.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.divByMonic_X_pow_add_one`: the quotient in closed form, as the shifted upper half.
* `Polynomial.coeff_divByMonic_X_pow_add_one`: its coefficientwise form, the one consumers use.
