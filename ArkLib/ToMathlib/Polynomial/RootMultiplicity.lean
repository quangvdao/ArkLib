# Additional polynomial root-multiplicity lemmas

## Main statements

* `Polynomial.sum_rootMultiplicity_le_natDegree` — root multiplicities summed over a finite
  set are bounded by the degree.
* `Polynomial.eq_zero_of_degree_lt_mul_of_pow_X_sub_C_dvd_at_injOn` — a polynomial with
  sufficiently many distinct roots of uniform multiplicity and strictly smaller degree is zero.
* `Polynomial.eq_zero_of_natDegree_lt_mul_of_pow_X_sub_C_dvd_at_injOn` — the corresponding
  natural-degree formulation.

Generic facts intended as candidates for upstreaming to Mathlib.

/-- A polynomial is zero when it has at least `requiredPoints` distinct prescribed roots, each
with multiplicity at least `multiplicity`, and its degree is strictly below the resulting total
multiplicity. The evaluation map only needs to be injective on the supplied indices.

This degree formulation deliberately permits `multiplicity = 0`, `requiredPoints = 0`, and an
empty index set. In those cases the strict degree hypothesis forces `W = 0`, because the zero
polynomial is the only polynomial whose `WithBot`-valued degree is below zero. -/

`Polynomial.eq_zero_of_degree_lt_mul_of_pow_X_sub_C_dvd_at_injOn`.

Unlike the `degree` formulation, this theorem's strict hypothesis is impossible when either
`multiplicity = 0` or `requiredPoints = 0`, even for `W = 0`, because `natDegree 0 = 0`. -/
