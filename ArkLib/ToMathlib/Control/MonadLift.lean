# Pushing a projection through a monad lift

`monadLift_bind_map` moves a post-composed function from the continuation of a lifted computation
into the lifted computation itself. It is the `monadLift`-generic form of `bind_map_left`, and is a
two-step composite of the Lean core lemmas `monadLift_map` and `bind_map_left`.

Upstreaming candidate: the statement mentions nothing outside Lean core, so it belongs beside
`Init.Control.Lawful.MonadLift.Lemmas`.

Note on normal forms: core's simp set already rewrites this lemma's right-hand side *into* its
left-hand side (via `liftM_map` and `bind_map_left`, both `@[simp]`), so this is deliberately not
tagged `@[simp]` — use it explicitly, typically right-to-left to expose a lemma about `h <$> x`.
