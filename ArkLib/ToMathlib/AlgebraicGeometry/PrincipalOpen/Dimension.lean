# Dimension comparison for principal localizations

This module records the algebra direction needed when source coordinates are reconstructed only
after inverting a separant.  A surjection from a polynomial algebra onto the localized coordinate
ring bounds the dimension of the original prime by the number of source variables.  The inverse
of the localized element is accounted for by the explicit away presentation; it is not counted as
a freely adjoined generator.

/-- If a polynomial algebra on `τ` surjects onto the localization of a prime affine coordinate
ring, then the original prime has dimension at most `|τ|`.

The quotient by the kernel of `g` is isomorphic to the localized ring.  Comparing that quotient
with the explicit away presentation gives the correct direction: the away-presentation dimension,
and hence the original dimension, is at most the dimension of the polynomial source. -/
