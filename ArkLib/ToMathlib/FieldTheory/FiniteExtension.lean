# Sufficiently large extensions of finite fields

Mathlib provides `FiniteField.Extension k p n`, a chosen degree-`n` extension of a finite field
`k` of characteristic `p`. This file chooses an explicit positive degree whose extension has more
than a prescribed number of elements. The construction changes cardinality but preserves
characteristic; this distinction matters in characteristic-sensitive root-counting arguments.

/-! ### Fixed-degree extensions -/

/-- A fixed positive extension degree gives an extension of exact cardinality `|k| ^ degree`.
The explicit largeness hypothesis is retained so quantitative callers can choose `degree`
independently of the bound they ultimately prove. -/

/-! ### A coarse bound-dependent choice -/

/-- A positive extension degree for which the resulting finite field has cardinality strictly
larger than `bound`.

This is an existence-oriented choice. Its degree depends on `bound`, so it must not be used by
itself to claim a fixed-power quantitative estimate such as `|k| ^ (4 * d + 6)`. Such estimates
should instead choose a fixed `degree` and invoke `extension_spec_of_lt_pow`. -/

/-- The successor in `extensionDegreeAbove` is essential even at the zero bound. -/

  simp [extensionDegreeAbove, Nat.log_zero_right]

/-- The first extension strictly larger than `2` over `ZMod 2` has degree two and four elements. -/

  have hlog : Nat.log 2 2 = 1 := Nat.log_eq_of_pow_le_of_lt_pow (by decide) (by decide)
  rw [natCard_extensionAbove, Nat.card_zmod]
  simp [extensionDegreeAbove, hlog]

/-- Enlarging a field never improves characteristic: this four-element extension still has
characteristic two. -/
example : ringChar (ExtensionAbove (ZMod 2) 2 2) = 2 := by
  rw [← Algebra.ringChar_eq (ZMod 2) (ExtensionAbove (ZMod 2) 2 2)]
