# Algebraic Weights

Appendix A.2 of [BCIKS20]: the weight function `Λ` on `F[Z][T]`, given by `Λ(Z) = 1` and
`Λ(T) = D + 1 - deg_Y H` extended additively (`weight`), its transport to `𝒪 H` via canonical
representatives (`regularWeight`), sub-additivity, and the key fact that reduction modulo `H̃`
never increases `Λ` (`weight_modByMonic_monicize_le`).

a polynomial is the maximal weight of all monomials appearing in it with non-zero coefficients.

/-- **`Λ` is fully additive**: `Λ(f · g) = Λ(f) + Λ(g)`.

Sub-additivity is `weight_mul_le'`.  The reverse inequality holds because the weight assignment
grades `F[Z][T]` — each `Λ`-homogeneous piece is spanned by monomials of that weight — so the
associated graded ring is again a polynomial ring, hence a domain, and the top-weight parts of `f`
and `g` cannot cancel.  Concretely: at the *largest* maximizing index `N_f` of `f` and `N_g` of `g`,
the coefficient of `T^{N_f + N_g}` in `f · g` is `f_{N_f} · g_{N_g}` plus terms of strictly smaller
`Z`-degree, because any other `(i, j)` with `i + j = N_f + N_g` has `i > N_f` or `j > N_g` and
maximality then costs at least one degree.  So that coefficient has `Z`-degree exactly
`deg f_{N_f} + deg g_{N_g}`, witnessing `Λ(f) + Λ(g) ≤ Λ(f · g)`. -/
