# Closed Horner-machine boundary and mutation checks

These kernel-checked executions use natural scalars, an instance of the machine's semiring
interface. They exercise the actual interpreter rather than replaying its correctness theorem.
The asymmetric coefficients distinguish reversed order and a copied final coefficient. Empty
input and zero coefficients check termination overhead and work independent of coefficient value.
The final mutant interchanges addition and multiplication while retaining the same instruction
count; its different result detects the wrong arithmetic order.
