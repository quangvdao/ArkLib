# A closed machine for Horner evaluation

Programs are arrays of instructions with literal jump targets. There are no host-language
callbacks, arbitrary pure expressions, or opaque polynomial-evaluation instructions. The five
instruction forms suffice for Horner's coefficient loop. An independent transition relation fixes
both the state changes and charges; a fuel interpreter is related to its finite traces.

Costs distinguish field additions, field multiplications, control dispatches, indexed code fetches,
data accesses, and emitted field elements. Each executed instruction has one dispatch and one
indexed fetch. Data accesses count the code-cell read as well as the named scalar/list register
reads and writes; control-register management belongs to dispatch. A list-cell read retrieves its
head and tail together. Zero is a literal constant, not a natural-number cast. The input point and
coefficient list are already materialized. Creating or converting these inputs is outside this
subroutine's contract, not a free instruction of the machine.

This is an abstract field-operation and data-access model. It does not measure the host Lean
interpreter's allocation, fuel bookkeeping, or wall-clock time. Refinement to a concrete field
representation and its bit costs is a separate obligation. Natural casts, field enumeration,
extension construction, and arbitrary polynomial operations are not primitives of this language.
