# Characteristic-safe descent in the highest jet variable

The singular-solution recursion for a polynomial differential equation repeatedly differentiates
in its highest active Hasse-jet variable. This file proves one complete descent step. If `Q`
depends on `Y_s` with individual degree `t < ringChar F`, then differentiating exactly `t` times
produces a nonzero polynomial independent of `Y_s`. Degrees in every other variable do not
increase. Consequently, if `s` was the highest active jet, every active jet in the residual
polynomial has order strictly below `s`.

The strict characteristic hypothesis is essential: the derivative of `Y_s ^ p` is zero in
characteristic `p`.
