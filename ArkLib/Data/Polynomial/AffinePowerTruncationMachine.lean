# Charged truncated affine powers

The machine materializes the first M coefficients of `(a + T)^n` in increasing degree order.
It initializes the truncated constant one, then performs n passes `new[i] = a*old[i]+old[i-1]`,
with a zero predecessor at index zero. Every pass explicitly reverses its accumulated output.
No polynomial arithmetic, coefficient extraction, binomial coefficient or power primitive is
executed. Semantics use polynomials only in the proof.

Each instruction has an upper charge of 32 units covering scalar arithmetic, control, natural
counter operations, register/cell access, allocation and output. A multiplication pass cell uses
one scalar multiplication and one addition; every other instruction uses neither. Pointer tails
may be shared. Host interpreter fuel, reclamation and scalar/natural bit costs are outside this
unit-operation model. The scalar parameter is an input, not an uncharged coefficient oracle.

The direct consumer is truncated local interpolation: this supplies coefficients of `(center+T)^x`
and of `(received+Z)^b₀`, where substituting Z=TU gives the diagonal T/U coefficients. Combining
these factors, rewriting U and projecting contact order `i+d*b<m` remain separate assembly steps.
In particular, these coefficients do not assert vanishing of the full local substitution.
