# Quadratic jet Horner evaluation by base instructions

The point and descending coefficient list are materialized coordinate pairs. Initialization
allocates every coordinate zero and jet cell explicitly. An update suspends into multiplication
and addition programs, retains the OLD jet entry as the next carry, and allocates the updated
list cell in a separate save phase. Reversal and output traverse the actual materialized list.

Input construction and semantic decoding are outside execution. Each child instruction retains
its complete base ledger plus a dispatch/root wrapper. Launch reads operands/parameter and writes
the three input registers; return reads and installs the pair. Retained list roots are shared.
The model counts primitive operations, not compiled execution, interpreter fuel or bit complexity.
