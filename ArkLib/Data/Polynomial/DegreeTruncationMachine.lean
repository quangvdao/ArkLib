# Checked truncation of descending coefficient vectors

To restrict a width-`w` polynomial to degree less than `k`, inspect its first `w-k` coefficient
cells and reject if any is nonzero. On success the remaining list is shared, not copied.
Leading zeros are therefore removed only after being checked. The supplied width is a physical
representation parameter; its equality to input length is explicit in the polynomial theorem.

The closed machine charges every scalar equality, natural operation, cursor access, dispatch,
and output handle. It does not charge input materialization, host fuel, or scalar bit costs.
The intended consumer is the final degree filter of a polynomial list decoder.
