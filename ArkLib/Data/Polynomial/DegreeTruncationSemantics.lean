# Polynomial meaning of checked coefficient truncation

The executed zero-prefix test accepts exactly polynomials of degree less than the requested
dimension, including zero. Its output denotes the same polynomial and has the requested physical
width when the input ambient width is at least the dimension. No normalization assumption on
leading coefficients is used.
