# Literal multiplication refines scalar multiplication

The repeated-addition trace implements multiplication in the input modulus's residue ring,
including prime-field multiplication. Its countdown input is canonical; the multiplicand and
modulus may carry padding, which is included in the physical-width bound and retained exactly.
