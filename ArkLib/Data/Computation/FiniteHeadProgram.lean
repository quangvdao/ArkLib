# Finite control with head-only observations of a fixed bit-tape bank

The dispatch table receives only a finite control label and one optional bit per tape. It
returns a control label and one keep, pop or literal-bit push per tape. Whole words never enter
that interface. All updates read the old bank simultaneously. Popping an empty tape keeps it
empty. This strengthens locality with an explicit restriction on how instructions are selected;
it is not a global RAM compiler or a bound on address, heap or scalar arithmetic.
