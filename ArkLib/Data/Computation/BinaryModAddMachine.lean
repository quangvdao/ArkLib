# Literal modular addition with retained modulus

Seven fixed physical tapes hold the four arithmetic tapes, the retained modulus, a sum backup,
and a reversal scratch tape. Each copy is a pair of charged local-bit passes. A recorded borrow
selects the backup sum or reduced difference; discarded bits are cleared explicitly.
