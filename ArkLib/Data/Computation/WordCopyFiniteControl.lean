# Literal finite-head implementation of retained word copying

Four finite control labels select clearing, saving, restoration and halt. Only the destination,
source or scratch head is inspected in its respective phase. The three physical tapes remain
source zero, scratch one and destination two. Every original word-copy transition, including
arbitrary suspended entries and halt, is exactly one step of this finite-head program.
