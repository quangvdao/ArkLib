# Kernel-checked algebraic execution boundary checks

These examples reduce the interpreter itself; they do not invoke the routine correctness
theorems. The literal input heap represents descending coefficients `[2, 3, 5]` and points
`[1, 4]` over the field of seventeen elements. Reading the final registers/cells is a test
observation, not an extra machine instruction or an asserted free output conversion.
