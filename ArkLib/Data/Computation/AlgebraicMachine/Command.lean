# Structured algebraic programs and charged execution

Programs contain only the closed primitive menu and finite control syntax. In particular,
neither a branch nor a call carries a Lean callback. Calls share the fixed register bank;
their register-preservation requirements belong to the calling convention of each program.

Every transition costs one: primitive execution, sequence dispatch, branch and loop tests,
call entry, and return. A failed primitive or a non-Boolean test is stuck, not a successful
termination. The compositional execution judgment below is connected to these transitions,
so its cost is not an independently assigned annotation on a mathematical function.
