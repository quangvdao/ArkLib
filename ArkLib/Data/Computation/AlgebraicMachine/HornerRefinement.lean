# Algebraic-machine refinement of polynomial evaluation

The materialized coefficient list is an input. Its relation to a computational polynomial
is a precondition, not an uncharged conversion performed by the program. The same fixed
program works for every list length and field. Its output agrees with the existing Horner
reference machine; the two machines have different, separately proved cost models.
