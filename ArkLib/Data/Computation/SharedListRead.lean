# Literal reads of represented shared-list cells

The cell representation is defined by memory observations, not by successful execution.
Here an actual block read recovers exactly those tag/head/tail bits, preserving the entire
memory and hence every shared tail. The length tape is an explicit already-materialized input.
Separating the returned payload into scalar/pointer registers is not asserted as a free step.
