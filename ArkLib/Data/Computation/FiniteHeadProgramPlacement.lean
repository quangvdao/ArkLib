# Static physical placement of a finite-head program

An immutable finite wiring selects distinct physical tapes. The placed program reads only their
heads and directs its literal actions to those positions; every unowned position receives keep.
There is one runtime bank. Projection and framing are proof-side descriptions of that bank,
never instructions that copy, mirror or rename whole words. Placement preserves the exact count
of simultaneous finite-head transitions; it is not a serial bit-RAM or heap compiler.
