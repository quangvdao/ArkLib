# Same-run address-controller correctness

The count is exactly `3 * address.length + 8` bit-RAM transitions: start, two bit traversals,
their phase changes, one architectural access, and complete bus reset. The initial path is already
materialized. The observer's Lean fuel recursion is not a measured host runtime. Both correctness
and frame properties refer to the actual memory returned by that same literal controller run.
