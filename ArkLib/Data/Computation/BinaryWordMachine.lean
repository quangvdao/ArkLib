# Literal binary-word local tape controller

Words are little-endian bit lists. The fixed controller consumes at most one cell from each
input per step and updates only finite Boolean control. Addition emits its sum bit and retains
the carry. Comparison retains the ordering of the most significant differing bit seen so far.
Output normalization trims leading zeros on the reversed result and restores order one bit per
transition. No numeric arithmetic, length, whole-list traversal, or callback runs in dispatch.

Counts are simultaneous finite-control local bit-RAM transitions in `BitLocalActions`, the same
interface satisfied by `AddressedBits`. They are not host evaluation time. Heap load/store,
input materialization, and architectural address accesses remain separate caller obligations.
