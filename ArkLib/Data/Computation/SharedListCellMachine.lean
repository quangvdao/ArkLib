# Literal payload construction and shared-list cell writing

One fixed eleven-tape controller first materializes the payload, then writes it through the actual
bit-block child. The base stays on tape zero and payload output on tape four through the one-step
handoff. Retained head/tail words stay on tapes nine/ten while the writer uses tapes zero to eight.
No phase change relocates or copies a whole tape. The same memory flows into every writer step.

The supplied words and fresh fixed-width pointer are already materialized. Pointer selection,
scalar encoding, reads, and a full decoder bit-cost refinement are separate obligations. The
transition count includes payload construction, the literal handoff, and every writer transition.
It is a count in the stated bit-RAM model, not native Lean execution time.
