# Binary-word values and actual local-bit executions

Natural-number operations below are specifications and proof-side bounds. The executed successor
is the Boolean/local-cell controller in `BinaryWordMachine`. Inputs may contain high zero padding;
addition produces canonical output with at most one extra bit and includes carry-in explicitly.
