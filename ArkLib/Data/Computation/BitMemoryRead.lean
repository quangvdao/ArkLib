# Bit-by-bit reads from prefix-addressed memory blocks

The caller supplies a binary block pointer and a materialized length tape: one cell for
each requested bit. The values on the length tape are ignored. Pointer and within-word index
copying/restoration, address access/reset, and output reversal all use literal bit transitions.
No transition decodes a length or loads an entire word. The starting length tape and pointer
must be constructed by the caller; this module does not charge their construction for free.
