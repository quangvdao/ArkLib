# Address transfer in a bit RAM

Addresses are binary paths with an implicit leading one. The empty path denotes address one;
zero is reserved and has no address value. Thus every path has one canonical wire encoding,
`true :: path`, including paths starting with false. Distinct paths name distinct memory cells.

The literal controller transfers each input bit, restores wire order one bit at a time, performs
one addressed bit access, then erases every bus bit before returning. Every successor counts as
one **bit-RAM transition**. The terminal read/write is an openly stipulated random-access RAM
primitive. `Memory.lookup` and `Memory.write` give its executable finite-trie semantics; their host
evaluation time is not the transition count. In particular this is no tape simulation, native-time
bound, or compiler-correctness claim. No instruction accepts an arbitrary callback.

Input paths are already materialized on the local input tape. Starting writes the implicit leading
one. List head/tail operations model single local tape-cell operations, not random heap-list
operations. Shared heap representations and scalar arithmetic are separate future refinements.
