# Literal equality guard retaining its modulus

The actual binary comparison consumes both supplied words. One finite-control transition maps
its resulting ordering to a Boolean guard. The modulus stays on a fifth physical tape throughout.
There is no extra entry transition: the initial state contains the original comparison entry.
