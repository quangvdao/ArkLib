# Literal cell payload materialization

Five fixed local bit tapes hold the head word, its saved copy, the tail pointer, its saved copy,
and the output. Copy/restore phases preserve both supplied words while pushing their bits onto
the output in the required order. A final bit push adds the live-cell tag. No successor performs
a whole-word concatenation, reversal, or copy; these operations occur only in the specification.

The input words are already materialized. Their interpretation as scalar values or fixed-width
address prefixes is outside this controller. The exact local transition count does not include
pointer selection, heap writes, a handoff to another controller, or native Lean evaluation.
