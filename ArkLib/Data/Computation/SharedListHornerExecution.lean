# Same-run correctness of the physical shared-list Horner loop

Every iteration includes actual uncons, cleanup of the old pointer/index, physical tail movement,
multiplication, addition and all handoffs. The coefficient heap is unchanged. The fold below
specifies the output of this one physical run; no abstract list or arithmetic callback executes
inside the controller. The entry accumulator and evaluation point are materialized reduced words.
