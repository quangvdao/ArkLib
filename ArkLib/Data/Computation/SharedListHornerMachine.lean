# A physical shared-list Horner loop

The same RAM and twenty-one physical tapes execute uncons, pointer/index cleanup, two-pass
movement of the tail pointer, scalar multiplication and scalar addition. Coefficients are
consumed highest degree first. No list operation, scalar encoding, whole-word relocation or
clearing is an instruction. Child terminal handoffs preserve every tape literally.

The loop-header entry takes an already materialized accumulator, point, modulus and coefficient
pointer. Initial accumulator reset is outside this entry. Only the existing local-bit RAM model
is claimed; the interpreter's native running time is not the transition cost.
