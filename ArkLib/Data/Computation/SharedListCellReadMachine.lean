# Literal cell reads with physical head and tail extraction

The block reader produces an actual payload on tape 10. Its live tag is checked, then a
materialized head-length tape controls a bitwise split. The head is reversed onto tape 13;
the untouched payload suffix stays on tape 10 as the tail pointer. All fourteen physical
tape positions are fixed through every handoff. No list `take`, `drop`, length computation,
whole-word movement, or uncharged parsing runs in the successor.

Both length tapes and the pointer are caller-provided physical inputs. A represented live cell
returns its exact head/tail and unchanged memory. Nil-pointer testing and construction of the
length tapes are separate obligations; malformed tag/short payload rejection retains the tapes.
