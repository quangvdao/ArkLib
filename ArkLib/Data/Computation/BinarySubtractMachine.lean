# Literal saturating binary subtraction

The four physical tapes match the addition controller. A fixed full-subtractor consumes one
bit from each nonempty input and pushes one result bit. Final underflow clears the temporary
tape one cell at a time. Otherwise the existing literal normalization controller restores a
canonical result. Borrow-in implements decrement without constructing a numeric constant.
