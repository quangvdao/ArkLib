# Literal modular negation controller

The modulus and operand are physical input tapes. The operand is scanned for a nonzero bit,
then restored one bit per step before subtraction. Zero operands, including padded zero, clear
both inputs explicitly. Nonzero operands call the literal subtraction controller. No numeric
value test, free copy, or free restoration runs in dispatch.
