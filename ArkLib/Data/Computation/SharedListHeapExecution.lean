# Literal shared-list cell writes

The supplied pointer and complete payload are already materialized local bit tapes. A payload
layout equation describes these existing bits; this module does not charge for or execute their
construction, concatenation, scalar encoding, or fresh-pointer selection. The literal block
controller then writes every bit through the addressed-bit access and reset machine.

The same final configuration carries the new represented cons cell, its old tail, all other old
represented lists, and unchanged observations on every disjoint equal-width pointer block.
The exact transition count is the block controller's count, not native Lean time. No read/lookup
controller, allocator, or full decoder bit-complexity claim is asserted here.
