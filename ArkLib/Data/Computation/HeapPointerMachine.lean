# Literal fixed-width pointer increment

The four-tape controller preserves every bit position, including high zero padding. It retains
the original pointer and produces the incremented word plus a Boolean overflow flag. Carry,
copying and restoration use single-bit local actions. No successor decodes, re-encodes, trims,
or enumerates addresses. Pointer words remain bit strings used as physical address prefixes;
proof-side numerical labels are supplied separately and are not architectural addresses.

This is the next-pointer operation, not a complete allocator. Freshness, heap writes, and the
same-bank composition with a writer are separate contracts. RAM is unchanged by this controller.
