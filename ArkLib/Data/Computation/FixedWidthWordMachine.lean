# Literal fixed-width words and physical width markers

Padding consumes an explicit marker tape, emits one bit per marker, and physically reverses
the result. Excess input is rejected without clearing any remaining tape. A separate entry
constructs a marker tape from an existing reference word, preserving that word by copying and
restoring every bit. Neither entry decodes an integer length or performs a whole-list operation.
