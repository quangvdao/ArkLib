# Fixed-width scalar addition on one physical tape bank

The literal modular adder feeds its actual result into reference-width construction and
padding. The modulus is retained throughout. The only handoff changes finite control, not
tape contents; all copying, clearing and padding is charged by the two child programs.

This instruction consumes its two already materialized operands and returns a reduced word
of exactly the modulus's physical width. It is not a complete decoder compiler or a claim
about native Lean execution time.
