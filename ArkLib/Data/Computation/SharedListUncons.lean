# Literal uncons of a represented shared list

Every pointer bit is popped onto a saved tape and inspected, then physically restored. A finite
Boolean flag selects empty versus the prepared live-cell reader. The modulus-width reference,
original pointer and RAM are preserved; no pointer equality oracle or free word copy runs in
`step`. Both branches use the same sixteen tape positions as the prepared reader.

The correctness input is a represented list, not a separately supplied live cell. The same
bounded run returns either empty or its exact first word and a pointer representing the rest.
For unrepresented nonzero pointers the actual reader may reject or return arbitrary heap data;
no successful list semantics are asserted. The empty branch depends only on pointer bits.
