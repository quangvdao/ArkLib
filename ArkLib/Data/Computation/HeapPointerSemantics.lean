# Fixed-width pointer labels and bump freshness

Little-endian natural values label fixed-width pointer codewords injectively. They are not the
architectural RAM address: the literal block controller still constructs its address from the
actual prefix bits and unary slot suffix. No conversion or address enumeration is executed here.

The heap invariant says that every codeword at or above the bump label has a false live tag.
Increment has explicit overflow and preserves width. A write at the current pointer preserves the
invariant at its successful successor, including when the cell is written by the actual writer.
Pointer increment and cell writing have separate traces here; no combined allocator handoff or
allocation cost certificate is assumed. Nil is reserved independently of overflow behavior.
