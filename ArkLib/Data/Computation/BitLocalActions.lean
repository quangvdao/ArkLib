# Shared local bit-tape interface

One finite-control bit-RAM transition can keep, pop one bit from, or push one bit onto each of
four local stacks. Its finite Boolean control can inspect their heads. This is a local storage
interface, not permission to execute arbitrary transformations of words in one step. Clients
supply fixed literal controllers and prove every successor has this shape.

The address controller inhabits exactly this interface: restoration reads the former bus tape
and writes the former input tape. No phase change copies or exchanges a whole list. The separate
architectural random-access operation remains precisely the one documented by `AddressedBits`.
