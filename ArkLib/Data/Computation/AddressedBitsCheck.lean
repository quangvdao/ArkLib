# Address-controller execution canary

Actual writes at two distinct addresses followed by an overwrite and reads distinguish aliasing,
wrong wire order, failure to update, and failure to preserve other cells. The empty path is a valid
root address. Raw malformed wire words are rejected. One transition before the public bound the
bus is empty but the controller has not yet returned. All checks use kernel reduction.

/-- Full reset is necessary; malformed raw addresses cannot alias the valid root address. -/
example :
    let mem := (store .empty [] true).memory
    runFuel 7 ⟨mem, .start .read []⟩ = ⟨mem, .reset (some true) []⟩ ∧
    runFuel 8 ⟨mem, .start .read []⟩ = ⟨mem, .done (some true)⟩ ∧
    runFuel 2 ⟨mem, .access .read []⟩ = ⟨mem, .done none⟩ ∧
    runFuel 3 ⟨mem, .access (.write false) [false]⟩ = ⟨mem, .done none⟩ := by
