# Structural shared lists in addressed bit memory

Pointers have a common fixed width; the all-zero pointer is reserved for nil. A cell stores a
true tag, a fixed-width bit word, and a tail pointer in consecutive unary-indexed slots. The
inductive representation describes actual memory observations independently of any successful
execution. Multiple lists may share a tail. A false tag provides freshness relative to every
represented list, without requiring unused bits elsewhere in that pointer block to be zero.

The finite write folds below are semantic specifications only. No allocation, lookup, or bit-cost
claim is made until a literal addressed-bit controller is proved to realize these observations.
