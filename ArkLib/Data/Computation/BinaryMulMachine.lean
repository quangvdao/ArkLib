# Literal repeated-addition scalar multiplication

Eleven physical bit tapes hold the seven modular-add tapes plus a binary countdown, a retained
multiplicand, a shuttle, and a held accumulator. Countdown decrements and every operand copy,
transfer and restoration execute literal local-bit loops. The modulus and multiplicand remain
on their original tapes at completion. Empty canonical countdown is the sole loop exit test.
