# Remaining capacity for actual shared-list allocations

A fixed-width bump pointer reserves one nonzero successor after the last permitted allocation.
The invariant below derives the allocator's no-overflow premise from an explicit remaining
allocation budget. Each successful execution preserves every old represented list and decreases
that budget by one. It does not assert that a whole decoder stays within a particular budget;
that requires the decoder's separate lifetime-allocation bound and input initialization proof.
