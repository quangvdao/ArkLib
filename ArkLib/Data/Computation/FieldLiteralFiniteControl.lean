# Finite-head control for physical field literals

The literal controller has twenty-four finite labels and six fixed tapes. Its table includes
both zero/one entries and all suspended shape or padding child phases. Output remains tape zero,
scratch tape two, reference tape four and the padding child's spare output tape five. Every
branch inspects only current heads. Every original transition and all fuel prefixes are matched
exactly, including a zero-width one request and halted or rejected child entries.
