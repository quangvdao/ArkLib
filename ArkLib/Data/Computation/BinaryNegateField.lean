# Modular negation refines scalar negation

The word machine computes the same additive inverse as `ZMod`. This applies to every positive
modulus and hence, in particular, to prime-field scalars. The theorem uses the actual literal
execution witness; no algebraic operation is added to the machine's runtime instruction set.
