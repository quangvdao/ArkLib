# Literal fixed-width bump allocation

One twelve-tape program increments the supplied current pointer, checks the actual carry flag,
and either performs the actual payload/cell writer or stops with explicit overflow. Current
pointer bits stay on tape zero, next-pointer bits on tape eleven, and supplied head/tail words
on tapes nine/ten. The successful handoff to the writer changes no tape content. Overflow also
retains all tapes and the entire RAM; it never writes through the wrapped nil pointer.

Inputs satisfy a common fixed width, a non-nil current pointer and the `AboveFree` heap invariant.
The total successor function is not a validator for malformed inputs outside those contracts.
Numerical pointer labels are proof-side codeword labels, not architectural addresses. Input-word
materialization, heap initialization, and a complete decoder refinement remain separate.
