# Shared-list cell reads with physically constructed width markers

The input is a pointer and a retained scalar-width reference, such as the modulus. Actual
payload construction copies these words into a block marker; actual shape construction copies
and restores the reference to produce the head marker. Both markers feed the existing literal
cell reader on one fixed sixteen-tape bank. Their bit values are irrelevant to the reader.

The live-cell theorem needs no caller-provided length tapes. Nil testing remains a separate
instruction: this entry reads a cell and does not interpret the all-zero pointer as an empty
list. A malformed tag remains the child's retained rejection state. No validity check or
list-level operation is assumed free. Costs count this explicit bit-RAM program only.
