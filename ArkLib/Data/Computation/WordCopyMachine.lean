# Retained bit-word copying with physical destination clearing

Three fixed tapes hold source, scratch, and destination. The destination is cleared one bit at
a time, then two passes restore the source and produce an identical destination. No whole-word
assignment executes. The count includes the old destination's length, so overwriting a register
cannot hide its cleanup. Source and destination are distinct physical tape positions.
