# Modular addition correctness with charged storage

The same trace includes addition, two physical copies, the recorded-borrow subtraction, and
backup recovery or clearing. The modulus is retained exactly and all scratch tapes are empty
at the final state. Numeric modulus and width arithmetic occur only in specifications.
