# Same-run multiplication by a physical binary countdown

The proof inducts on the value of the actual canonical countdown tape. Each nonempty counter
executes a complete literal decrement/copy/modular-add round. The cost is linear in the counter
value and physical widths, hence has absolute polynomial degree in the field size.
