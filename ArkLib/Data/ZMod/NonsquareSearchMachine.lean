# Closed nonsquare search

Two explicit counter loops enumerate candidates and possible square roots by adding one.
Every candidate scans all roots; a Boolean records whether a square matched. Squaring,
equality/Boolean updates, counter operations, resets, and output are distinct charged transitions.
The proof specifications are not primitives of executable dispatch. No primality decision is
performed: odd primality guarantees success, while returned values are sound for every modulus.
Costs are abstract scalar/register operations, excluding input materialization, host fuel,
reclamation and integer/field bit costs. This does not construct an extension field.
