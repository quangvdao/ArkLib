# Checked descent of quadratic coefficient vectors

The program scans actual two-coordinate coefficients. It rejects any nonzero imaginary
coordinate and otherwise materializes the real-coordinate list, preserving its order and
physical width. Each scalar equality, coordinate read, allocation, reversal and emission is
charged. The field structure and the input vector are supplied; host fuel and bit costs remain
outside the primitive model. No bulk projection or algebra-map conversion occurs in dispatch.
