# Exact base-coordinate descent and polynomial preservation

Successful descent means exactly that the original vector is the coefficientwise embedding
of the returned base vector. There is no promise that every extension-field candidate descends.
The polynomial statement uses descending Horner coefficients, matching the candidate filter.
