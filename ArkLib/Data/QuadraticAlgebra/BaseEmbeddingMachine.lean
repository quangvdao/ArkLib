# Materialized base-field alphabets in a quadratic algebra

Each instruction embeds one scalar as `(x,0)` and allocates its list cell. A charged reversal
restores the input order. The algebra map occurs only in the semantic specification, not as
an uncharged runtime traversal. Input roots are shared; each newly materialized coordinate and
list cell is charged. This supplies the restricted center/jet alphabet used by the decoder.
