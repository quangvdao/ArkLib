# Proof-erased certification of the executed field setup

The dependent result takes its nonsquare parameter, alphabets, samples and cost from the actual
setup run. Its proofs certify those observed values and are erased; they do not choose a field,
compute a root or enumerate a list. This interface lets a surrounding executable use the
computable quadratic-field dictionary without an additional nonsquare decision procedure.
