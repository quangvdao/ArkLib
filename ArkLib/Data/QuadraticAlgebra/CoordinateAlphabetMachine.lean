# Explicit materialization of a quadratic alphabet's coordinate pairs

The setup program returns lists of quadratic-algebra records. This controller reads their two
scalar fields and allocates raw pairs and list cells individually, then reverses the result.
Its logical specification uses a list map; dispatch does not. The same trace counts all record,
cell and cursor operations in the field-level data-access model, not in a bit-time model.
