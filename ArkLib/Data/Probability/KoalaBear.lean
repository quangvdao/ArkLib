# Computable sampling for the KoalaBear sextic extension

This file gives `KoalaBear.Ext6` a pinned `SampleableType` implementation. It samples a vector of
six independent base-field limbs and transports that vector through the executable coefficient
representation of the extension field. In particular, it does not enumerate the `q ^ 6` extension
elements or use `SampleableType.ofFintype`.
