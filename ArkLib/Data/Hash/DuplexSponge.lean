  # Duplex Sponge API (Overwrite Mode)

  This file contains the API for the duplex sponge, which is a sponge that can be used to hash
  data.

  The API is based on the [spongefish](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/spongefish) Rust library.

  The API is designed to be as close as possible to the Rust implementation (as of June 22, 2025).

  The API is subject to change as spongefish changes.

/-- Type class for types that can be used as units in a cryptographic sponge.

Following the [spongefish](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/spongefish) Rust library, we require the
following:

- The type has a zero (i.e. `Zero` in Lean, simpler than a `zeroize` method)
- The type can be serialized and deserialized to/from `ByteArray`
- The type has a fixed size in bytes
- The type implements `write` and `read` methods, which are used to write and read the unit to/from
  an IO stream. They are implemented by default using the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods, and
  the `IO.FS.Stream.{read/write}` functions.

/-- Type class for types that can be used as a duplex sponge, with respect to the sponge unit type
  `U`.

Following the [spongefish](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/spongefish) Rust library, we require the
following:

- The type is inhabited (`Default` in Rust), and can be zeroized (i.e. `Zeroize` in Rust)
- The type can be initialized from a 32-byte vector (seed)
- There are 3 methods:
  - `absorbUnchecked` to absorb an array of units in the sponge
  - `squeezeUnchecked` to squeeze out an array of units, changing the state of the sponge
  - `ratchetUnchecked` to ratchet the state of the sponge
-/
class DuplexSpongeInterface (U : Type) [SpongeUnit U] (α : Type*)
    extends Inhabited α, Zero α, Initialize α (Vector UInt8 32) where
  /-- Absorb new elements in the sponge.
  ```rust

  -/
  squeezeUnchecked : α × Array U → α × Array U

  /-- Ratcheting.

  ```

  More notes from the Rust implementation:
  ```rust
    /// This operations makes sure that different elements are processed in different blocks.
    /// Right now, this is done by:
    /// - permuting the state.
    /// - zero rate elements.

Rust interface:

    const N: usize;  // The width of the sponge
    const R: usize;  // The rate of the sponge
    fn new(iv: [u8; 32]) -> Self;
    fn permute(&mut self);
}
```
Note that we do not quite know how to handle `AsRef` and `AsMut`. My interpretation is that they
basically provide a way to get to the underlying state of the sponge, which is `Vector U N`. Because
of this, I give a tentative API for `AsRef` and `AsMut` basically as a lens between `α` and `Vector
U N` (i.e. `view` and `update`).

UPDATE: we also move the `permute` function out of the sponge state class, as our functions
`absorb/squeeze/ratchet` will be defined as oracle computations (having access to oracle API of a
permutation, i.e. two oracles of type `C → C` for forward and backward directions).

UPDATE: we also modularize this type class by not requiring extra properties like Inhabited. So
really, we just have a lens between `α` and `Vector U N`, along with Zeroize and Initialize.

### Absorb a list of units into the sponge (paper version)

Paper algorithm (process one element at a time):
1. Set `i_s' := R` (forces a permutation on the next squeeze).
2. If the input is empty, return immediately.
3. Otherwise:
   - If `absorb_pos < R` then permute the state and set `absorb_pos := 0`.
   - Let `x` be the first input element and `x'` the remaining elements.
   - Overwrite `state[absorb_pos]` with `x` (using `Vector.set`).
   - Set `absorb_pos := absorb_pos + 1` and recursively call on `x'`.

The differences from the Rust version:
1. We use `List` instead of `Array`.
2. We absorb one element at a time, not chunks.

Difference from the paper: we fold the permute into an if-else branch, instead of invoking recursion
on that branch (thus complicating the termination argument). Note also that we have structural
recursion here, which is better behaved definitionally than well-founded recursion.
-/
def absorb (sponge : DuplexSponge U C) (ls : List U) :
    OracleComp (forwardPermutationOracle C) (DuplexSponge U C) :=
  match ls with
  -- If the list is empty, return the sponge with the squeezing index set to the end of the rate
  -- segment
  | [] => pure { sponge with squeezePos := Fin.last SpongeSize.R }
  -- Otherwise, process the list one element at a time
  | x :: xs =>
    -- If the absorbing index is at the end of the rate segment, permute the state, overwrite the
    -- first unit of the state vector with the first element of the list, reset the absorbing index
    -- to one, and set the squeezing index to the end of the rate segment
    if sponge.absorbPos = SpongeSize.R then do
      let permutedState ← query (spec := forwardPermutationOracle _) (sponge.state)
      let newSponge : DuplexSponge U C := {
        state := SpongeState.modify permutedState (Vector.set · 0 x),
        absorbPos := 1
        squeezePos := Fin.last SpongeSize.R }
      -- Then recursively run absorb on the remaining list
      absorb newSponge xs
    else do
      -- Otherwise, overwrite the absorbing index with the first element of the list, increment the

        squeezePos := Fin.last SpongeSize.R }
      absorb newSponge xs

/--
### Absorb an array of units into the sponge (Rust version)

Difference from the paper version: we absorb chunks at a time, not a single element at a time.

1. Set `squeeze_pos := R` at entry.
2. While `input` is nonempty:
   - If `absorb_pos == R` (rate full):
     • Permute the state and reset `absorb_pos := 0`.
     • Continue with the same `input` (no input consumed in this step).
   - Else:
     • `chunk_len := min(input.len, R - absorb_pos)`.
     • Copy `chunk_len` items from `input` into `state[absorb_pos .. absorb_pos + chunk_len)`.
     • Update `absorb_pos += chunk_len` and drop `chunk_len` from `input`.

To guide Lean's termination proof, we use the pair `(arr.size, absorbPos)` (with lex order)
as the termination measure.
-/
def absorbFast (sponge : DuplexSponge U C) (arr : Array U) :
    OracleComp (forwardPermutationOracle C) (DuplexSponge U C) := do
  -- Set `squeeze_pos = R` before entering the loop.
  let sponge1 := { sponge with squeezePos := Fin.last SpongeSize.R }
  -- If the array is empty, return the sponge with the squeezing index set to the end of the rate
  -- segment
  if hEmpty : arr.isEmpty then
    return sponge1
  else
    -- If the absorbing index is exactly at the end of the rate segment, we must permute
    -- and reset the absorbing index to 0, then recurse on the same input array.

### Squeeze out a vector of units from the sponge (paper version)

We differ from the paper version in that we fold in the permute step into the loop, instead of
having a recursive call with length unchanged (which would not fall under structural recursion).

Compared to the Rust version:
1. We squeeze out a precise number of `len` units, not into an array of undetermined size
2. Our squeezing is done one element at a time, not chunks
-/
def squeeze (sponge : DuplexSponge U C) (len : Nat) :
    OracleComp (forwardPermutationOracle C) (Vector U len × DuplexSponge U C) :=
  match len with
  -- If the length is 0, return an empty vector and the same sponge
  | 0 => pure (#v[], sponge)
  -- Otherwise, recursively squeeze out the first element and the rest
  | n + 1 => do
    -- Set absorbing index to zero
    let sponge1 : DuplexSponge U C := { sponge with absorbPos := 0 }
    let sponge2 ← if sponge1.squeezePos = SpongeSize.R then
      let permutedState ← query (spec := forwardPermutationOracle _) (sponge1.state)
      let sponge2 : DuplexSponge U C := { sponge1 with state := permutedState, squeezePos := 0 }
      pure sponge2
    else
      pure sponge1
    let squeezedVal := (SpongeState.get sponge2.state)[sponge2.squeezePos]
    let sponge3 := { sponge2 with squeezePos := sponge2.squeezePos + 1 }
    -- Recursively squeeze the rest
    let (restVec, sponge4) ← squeeze sponge3 n
    -- Return the concatenation of the squeezed value, the recursive squeezed vector, and the
    -- updated sponge
    return (restVec.insertIdx 0 squeezedVal, sponge4)

/--
### Squeeze out an array of units from the sponge (Rust version)

Unlike the paper version which specifies the length of the output, this version squeezes out
the rate segment "into" the given array.

1. If output array is empty, return immediately
2. Process output in chunks:
   - If squeeze_pos == R:
     * Permute the state first
     * Reset squeeze_pos = 0, absorb_pos = 0
   - Calculate chunk_size = min(remaining_output.length, R - squeeze_pos)
   - Copy state[squeeze_pos..squeeze_pos + chunk_size] into output
   - Update squeeze_pos += chunk_size
   - Recursively handle remaining output
3. Return updated sponge and filled output array

Note: Unlike absorb which processes input sequentially, squeeze may need to permute
multiple times if the requested output is larger than what's available in the rate.

We define this operation as an oracle computation having access to a permutation oracle.

### Ratchet the sponge state for domain separation
Algorithm (from Rust implementation):
1. Permute the state (ensures domain separation from previous operations)
2. Zero out the rate portion: state[0..R] = all zeros
   (This erases any information about previously absorbed elements)
3. Set squeeze_pos = R (forces permutation on next squeeze operation)
