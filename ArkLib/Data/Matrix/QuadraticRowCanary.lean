# Kernel checks for coordinate row-add-multiple

Nontrivial coordinate products, ordered entries and literal ledgers test both arithmetic calls
and explicit output allocation. Empty and mismatched rows test terminal paths. A deliberately
different saved payload checks that suspended calls do not reconstruct their inputs.
