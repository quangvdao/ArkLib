# Coordinate row-add-multiple execution

Materialized coordinate rows are scanned in lockstep. Each multiplication and addition runs
one retained arithmetic payload through its actual base instructions. Addition returns a pair
to a separate cell-allocation phase; explicit reversal preserves entry order. Unequal lengths
reject without emitting a partial row. Augmented entries are processed like every other entry.

The ledger charges administrative accesses, call setup, each child instruction and wrapper,
returns, cell slots/root writes and output. Unchanged registers and lists are shared. Input
preparation, reclamation, host fuel and compiled/bit time are outside this primitive model.
