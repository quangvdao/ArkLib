# Coordinate first-pivot selection

The first nonzero coefficient is selected by actual base equality instructions with a retained
input record. Zero rows are saved and restored in order around the pivot; untouched tails and
RHS values are shared. Missing entries reject only when scanned. All output cells, the selected
option, zero literals and child wrappers are charged explicitly. Input preparation, host fuel,
reclamation and bit time are outside this primitive ledger.
