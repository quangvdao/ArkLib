# Vandermonde construction by quadratic coordinate instructions

Samples are materialized point/value coordinate pairs. Each row allocates the seed (1,0), then
executes the original coefficient, reversal, augmented-row and output-cell phases. Every next
power, including the final unused one, runs the actual base multiplication program. The input
record is constructed once at launch and retained throughout the call; unchanged frame registers
are shared. No bulk map, power, reversal or field-operation callback is executed.

The ledger preserves source administrative fields, charges seed slots/constants, call setup,
every base instruction and wrapper, and return. Outer save adds the root write beyond its two
reads and two cell-slot writes. Input preparation, host fuel and compiled/bit time are excluded.
