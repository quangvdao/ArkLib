# Coordinate pivot elimination

Lookup retains both original rows. Equality, inversion, negation and factor multiplication run
actual base instructions with inputs stored once. The resulting factor drives the actual
coordinate row machine, including reversal and rejection. Packed RHS entries are ordinary row
entries and receive the same arithmetic; their packing belongs to the augmented-column caller.

Every child step retains its ledger and pays a wrapper dispatch and two root accesses. The zero
comparison allocates its two-coordinate literal explicitly. Costs include returns and output;
input preparation, host fuel, reclamation and compiled/bit time remain outside this model.
