# Concrete row-operation machine checks

Asymmetric signed rows fix arithmetic orientation and reversal order. The remaining cases
distinguish exhaustion, both length-mismatch directions, and successful empty rows with no
field arithmetic.

example : runFuel (-2 : ℤ) 14 (.scan [2, 5, 11] [3, -2, 4] []) =

/-- Reversal is complete but emission is still pending one transition before termination. -/
example : runFuel (-2 : ℤ) 13 (.scan [2, 5, 11] [3, -2, 4] []) =

/-- A short source rejects after two arithmetic pairs, without reversing a partial output. -/
example : runFuel (-2 : ℤ) 7 (.scan [2, 5, 11] [3, -2] []) =
    (.rejected, ⟨2, 2, 7, 30, 1⟩) := by decide

/-- A short target follows the other rejection branch, even when no pair can be processed. -/
example : runFuel (2 : ℤ) 1 (.scan [] [7] []) =
    (.rejected, ⟨0, 0, 1, 2, 1⟩) := by decide

/-- Empty equal-length rows still initialize reversal and emit a successful result. -/
example : runFuel (2 : ℤ) 2 (.scan [] [] []) =
