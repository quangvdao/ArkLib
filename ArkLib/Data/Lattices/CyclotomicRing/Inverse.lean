# `Rq.inv` — Computable Inversion in the Cyclotomic Ring

`Rq Φ` is a *computable* `CommRing` (`ArkLib/Data/Lattices/CyclotomicRing/Rq.lean`), but
Mathlib's `Ring.inverse` is not: it dispatches on the undecidable `IsUnit` predicate through
classical choice. Any algorithm that divides in `Rq Φ` — notably the subtract-and-divide
extraction in `ArkLib/Commitments/Functional/Hachi/QuadEval/Soundness.lean` — therefore stops
being executable the moment it names `Ring.inverse`.

This file supplies the executable replacement. Since `φ` is monic and `R` is a field,
`R[X]` is a Euclidean domain, so the extended Euclidean algorithm on `(a, φ)` produces a
Bézout identity `g = s·a + t·φ`; CompPoly ships that algorithm (`CPolynomial.normXgcd`) with
its correctness proofs. Normalizing `g` to be monic makes `g = 1` exactly when `a` is
invertible modulo `φ`, and then `s` *is* the inverse. So the inverse is just the normalized
Bézout cofactor — no unit test and no case split are needed in the definition, which keeps it
total and `#eval`-able.

Correctness is stated only where it is meaningful, i.e. on units; off the units `Rq.inv`
returns whatever the Bézout cofactor happens to be, and callers are expected to carry an
`IsUnit` hypothesis — as [LS18] invertibility of short nonzero elements supplies
(`ArkLib/Data/Lattices/CyclotomicRing/NormBounds/`).

## Main definitions

* `CyclotomicModulus.Rq.inv` — the computable inverse, the normalized Bézout cofactor.

## Main results

* `CyclotomicModulus.Rq.isCoprime_of_isUnit` — a unit of `Rq Φ` is coprime to `φ` in `R[X]`.
* `CyclotomicModulus.Rq.inv_mul_cancel` / `mul_inv_cancel` — `inv` inverts units.
* `CyclotomicModulus.Rq.inv_eq_ringInverse` — on units it agrees with `Ring.inverse`, so
  every `Ring.inverse` lemma transfers.

/-! ## The inverse -/

/-- **The computable inverse on `Rq Φ`**: the cofactor of `a` in the monic-normalized Bézout
identity `g = s·a + t·φ` produced by the extended Euclidean algorithm. When `a` is a unit the
normalized `g` is `1`, so `s·a ≡ 1 (mod φ)` and `s` is the inverse (`inv_mul_cancel`); off the
units the value is unconstrained junk. Total and executable — no `IsUnit` test at the
definition, matching the totality of `Ring.inverse`, which it agrees with on units
(`inv_eq_ringInverse`). -/

/-! ## Correctness on units -/

/-- A unit of `Rq Φ` is coprime to the modulus in `R[X]`: an inverse `b` gives
`a·b − 1 ∈ (φ)`, which is a Bézout witness. This is the input to the gcd computation being
trivial, hence to `normXgcd` returning `1`. -/
