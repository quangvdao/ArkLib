# The Fixed Subring `R_q^H`

Hachi [NOZ26, §3, Lemma 5] shows that the subring `R_q^H` of elements fixed by every
automorphism in `H = ⟨σ_{-1}, σ_{4k+1}⟩` is a subfield isomorphic to `F_{q^k}`. This file
provides `R_q^H` as a `Subring`.

Because a homomorphism is fixed by all of `H` iff it is fixed by the *generators*, the fixed
subring is exactly the intersection of the equalizers of the two generating automorphisms with
the identity. We therefore define it via Mathlib's `RingHom.eqLocus`, which yields a genuine
`Subring` for free (no closure obligations):

  `R_q^H := eqLocus σ_{-1} id ⊓ eqLocus σ_{4k+1} id`.

The field structure and cardinality `|R_q^H| = q^k` (Lemma 5 / Eq. 7) live in
`CyclotomicRing/Subfield/` and are not addressed here.

## Main definitions

* `fixedSubring α k` — the subring `R_q^H` of `H`-fixed elements.
* `mem_fixedSubring_iff` — membership in terms of the two generators.

/-- The **fixed subring `R_q^H`** for `H = ⟨σ_{-1}, σ_{4k+1}⟩`: the elements fixed by both
generating automorphisms. Defined as the meet of the two generator equalizers with the identity,
so it is a `Subring` directly from Mathlib. By Hachi [NOZ26, Lemma 5] it is a subfield `≅ F_{q^k}`
(established elsewhere). -/

`σ_{-1}`. This is the first meet-factor of `fixedSubring`, and (for `q ≡ 5 (mod 8)`, established in
`Subfield/Field.lean`) it is a field, which is what makes `R_q^H ⊆ R_q^{σ_{-1}}` a field too. -/
