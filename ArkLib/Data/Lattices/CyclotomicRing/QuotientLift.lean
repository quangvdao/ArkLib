  # Quotient-presentation laws for `Rq Φ` — the cyclotomic HMZ25 lift instance

  The Huang–Mao–Zhang ring-switching lift ([HMZ25]; Hachi [NOZ26] §4.3, Figure 4 / Lemma 9)
  is formalized generically over a *quotient presentation* `S ≅ R[X]/(φ)` in
  `ArkLib/ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Lift/` — the lifted rows, the quotient-witness
  correspondence, and the `2d`-point interpolation engine all live there, stated over any
  monic modulus.

  This file supplies the **law-discharge lemmas for the cyclotomic instance** `S := Rq Φ`
  with canonical representatives `rep := (·.1.toPoly)` and modulus `Φ.φ.toPoly` (the instance
  itself, `cyclotomicPresentation`, is assembled protocol-side in
  `Commitments/Functional/Hachi/RingSwitch/Reduction.lean`, since `Data` does not import
  `ProofSystem`):

  * `val_toPoly_injective` — representatives are injective;
  * `modulus_dvd_toPoly_add_sub` / `modulus_dvd_toPoly_mul_sub` — the coset laws: reduction
    changes the representative of a sum/product by a multiple of the modulus, via the
    semantic quotient bridge `quotientHom`.

  The remaining presentation law — representatives are degree-reduced — is
  `Rq.natDegree_val_toPoly_lt'` in `Rq.lean`, next to the other `Rq` degree lemmas.

/-! ## Coset laws of the canonical representatives

Ring operations on `Rq Φ` reduce their result, so the representative of a sum/product differs
from the sum/product of representatives by a multiple of the modulus — exactly the
`IsPresentation` coset laws of the generic quotient-evaluation switch. Both proofs route
through the semantic quotient bridge: `quotientHom` identifies a polynomial with its
reduction. -/
