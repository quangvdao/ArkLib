# Sparse derivative execution and refinement

The interpreter implements first-occurrence differentiation for arbitrary factor lists. Its
polynomial interpretation is the partial derivative when each term has distinct variable
indices; this invariant is preserved. Runtime counts repeated additions against the numerical
exponent sum and does not claim polynomial time in binary exponent length alone.
