# Materializing base-field sparse polynomials in a quadratic algebra

Each input coefficient c is explicitly replaced by the coordinate value (c,0). Factor lists
are shared unchanged; coefficient, term and outer list cells are allocated and charged.
The output order is restored by a charged reversal. There is no runtime map callback or bulk
algebra-map conversion. Only the correctness statement uses the canonical scalar embedding.
The parameter a is supplied by field setup; no field operation is needed for this conversion.
