# Closed sparse partial differentiation

Terms use `EvaluationMachine.Term`: a coefficient and a materialized list of variable/exponent
pairs. The semantic theorem requires distinct variable indices within each term; term order,
variable order, duplicate terms, zero exponents and zero coefficients remain unrestricted.
Each coefficient is scaled by repeated addition, with no natural-to-field cast in dispatch.
Zero scaled coefficients are dropped, including characteristic-induced cancellation.

Every dispatch costs one control operation. Data counts include list reads, saved-prefix/output
allocations and register writes. Natural comparisons and predecessors, scalar additions/equality
tests, and outputs are separate. Literal zero/one and retained immutable handles are free.
Input preparation, reclamation, interpreter fuel and bit costs are separate obligations.
