  # Nested evaluation trees and their polynomial zero test

  A `NestedEvaluationTree F k n` is a complete `k`-ary tree of depth `n` whose nodes carry `k`
  scalar labels from `F`.  Labels below a node may depend on the path taken to that node, so these
  are genuine *nested* trees rather than Cartesian grids or coordinate-wise stars.  They are the
  shape of a transcript tree for `n` consecutive verifier rounds each drawing one scalar challenge
  with soundness parameter `k`.

  The main result is `NestedEvaluationTree.eq_zero_of_vanishes_comp`: if a polynomial whose
  individual degrees are all `< k` vanishes at every leaf of such a tree — read through *any* window
  of `r` consecutive tree levels — then the polynomial is zero.  The window formulation is what lets
  one
  tree certify several polynomials in disjoint variable blocks: the first `r` levels certify one,
  the last `r` levels certify another, and no tree projection or depth arithmetic is needed at the
  call site.

  Two distinct labels per node (`k = 2`) suffice for multilinear polynomials; the general `k`
  handles individual degree `≤ k - 1`.

  ## Why a tree, and not a star

  Vanishing on a coordinate-wise *star* — a center point plus, for each coordinate, further points
  differing from it in that coordinate alone — does **not** force a multilinear polynomial to
  vanish, however many points each arm carries: see
  `MvPolynomial.exists_nonzero_vanishing_on_axis_cross`. The complete tree supplies `k ^ n`
  points (`NestedEvaluationTree.numLeaves_eq_pow`) and, unlike a star, supports the interpolation
  induction below.

  ## Relation to the Cartesian-grid zero test

  `MvPolynomial.eq_zero_of_degreeOf_lt_card_of_eval_eq_zero_of_fin`
  (`ArkLib/Data/MvPolynomial/Interpolation.lean`) is the same statement for a product set
  `∏ᵢ S i`. Neither theorem subsumes the other: the tree here allows path-dependent labels, which a
  product set cannot express, while the grid version allows a *different* root count `#(S i)` per
  variable, which a tree of uniform arity `k` cannot — picking `k` from the largest `degreeOf`
  can exceed some `#(S j)`. So the two are siblings, and what they share — the head-variable root
  count — is factored out as
  `MvPolynomial.eq_zero_of_degreeOf_zero_lt_card_of_eval_C_eq_zero` and called by both.
  Making the grid version an actual corollary would need per-level arity here.

/-! ### Transport along a depth equation

A protocol adapter that reads a tree off a transcript indexed by *rounds remaining* produces its
depth as an arithmetic expression, so the two lemmas below are occasionally needed to move
`IsDistinct` and `Vanishes` across a depth equation.  Nothing in the zero test itself needs them:
the window formulation of `eq_zero_of_vanishes_comp` is what removes the depth arithmetic that
would otherwise arise from projecting a tree onto a prefix or a suffix. -/

/-- **Nested-tree zero test.**

Let `tree` be a complete `k`-ary evaluation tree of depth `n` with pairwise-distinct sibling
labels, and let `p` be a polynomial in `r` variables whose individual degrees are all `< k`.  Read
each leaf point through a window `f` of `r` consecutive tree levels starting at level `m`, i.e.
`(f i).val = m + i.val`.  If `p` vanishes at every windowed leaf point then `p = 0`.

Later labels may depend on the earlier path, and levels outside the window are simply skipped —
so one tree certifies a separate polynomial for each variable block, with no tree projection and
no depth subtraction.  The two cases used in practice are `f = Fin.castAdd` (the polynomial reads
the first `r` levels) and `f = Fin.natAdd` (it reads the last `r` levels).

The proof is a single induction on the tree.  At a level inside the window, fixing the first
variable preserves the degree bound for every remaining variable, so the induction hypothesis makes
all `k` restricted polynomials zero; the `k` distinct sibling labels are then `k` roots against
degree `< k` in that variable, which is
`MvPolynomial.eq_zero_of_degreeOf_zero_lt_card_of_eval_C_eq_zero` (shared with the Cartesian-grid
zero test).  At a level outside the window the proof simply descends into one child. -/
