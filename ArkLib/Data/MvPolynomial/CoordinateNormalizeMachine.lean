# Coordinate sparse normalization

The original insertion and factor-key cursors are retained. Coefficient addition and zero tests
execute the actual base arithmetic programs, with retained operands, zero literals and costs.
Cancellation drops the same term; duplicate keys and input order receive no bulk processing.
