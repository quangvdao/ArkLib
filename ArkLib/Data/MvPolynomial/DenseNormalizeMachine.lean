# Charged aggregation of sparse terms with explicit keys

The machine inserts each materialized input term into an aggregate list. Keys are compared one
variable/exponent pair at a time. Equal keys have their coefficients added; zero coefficients
and zero sums are dropped. Every traversed prefix is explicitly restored. There is no whole-list
equality, coefficient lookup, support computation or normalization primitive in dispatch.

Costs retain the sparse derivative's work/equality fields. Natural equality tests count separately
from scalar equality; a pair comparison is conservatively charged two natural tests.
List-constructor tests are dispatches; unchanged immutable handles are
retained. Input construction, reclamation, host fuel and bit costs are separate obligations.
