# Literal coordinate-allocation checks

Distinct coefficients and factor vectors detect reversal or coordinate swaps. Zero and repeated
terms must remain present. A short run retains its exact suspended output rather than emitting
early. These are kernel evaluations of the program, not uses of its correctness theorem.
