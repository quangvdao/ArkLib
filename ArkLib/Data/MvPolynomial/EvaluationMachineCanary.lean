# Concrete sparse-evaluation machine checks

The mixed case independently fixes the scalar result and every cost component. It includes repeated
indices, a constant term, and missing variables with positive and zero exponents. The remaining
checks distinguish exhausted fuel from emission and exercise both empty input lists.
