# Mutual correlated agreement is strictly stronger than correlated agreement

Correlated agreement is a threshold implication about `Code.jointAgreement`: if the random
combination is `δ`-close to the code with probability exceeding some threshold, then the words
jointly agree. Mutual correlated agreement (`CoreDefinitions.IsMCA`) is not of that shape, and this
file separates the two.

The bad events differ in where the agreement set is quantified. Correlated agreement's is
`combination is δ-close ∧ ¬ jointAgreement` — the words share *no* large agreement set. The mutual
one ties a single `T` to both clauses: the combination agrees with a codeword on `T` while some
`U j` does not agree on that same `T`. Joint agreement may therefore hold via some other set while
the mutual event still fires, making the mutual event the larger of the two.

The consequence is that a bound on `CoreDefinitions.mcaError` *implies* the corresponding threshold
statement — that direction is [BCGM25] Lemma 3.22, which is not formalized here — but is not
implied by it. `not_mcaError_le_iff_forall_jointAgreement` is the failing direction.

What is separated is the two *definitions*: the witness is a two-coordinate code at radius `1/2`,
and no correlated-agreement definition appears in any statement below. The quantitative question
[ABF26] leaves open after its Fact 4.5 is untouched.

## Main definitions

* `MCASeparation.repetitionCode` — `{(a, a)} ⊆ (ZMod 2)²`. Its projection onto either single
  coordinate is everything, which is what makes joint agreement unconditional at radius `1/2`.
* `MCASeparation.separatingFamily` — the pair `((0, 0), (1, 0))`: a codeword and a non-codeword.

## Main statements

* `MCASeparation.jointAgreement_repetitionCode` — *every* family jointly agrees, so every threshold
  implication about `Code.jointAgreement` holds by its consequent at any threshold.
* `MCASeparation.isMCA_repetitionCode` — the mutual event nevertheless fires, at seed `0`.
* `MCASeparation.mcaError_repetitionCode_pos` — hence the error value is positive.
* `MCASeparation.not_mcaError_le_iff_forall_jointAgreement` — below the error value, no threshold
  implication is equivalent to a `mcaError` bound.

/-- No threshold implication characterizes `mcaError`. At any threshold `t` strictly below the
error value — in particular at `t = 0`, by `mcaError_repetitionCode_pos` — the equivalence fails
for every threshold-side predicate `P`: the right-hand side holds because joint agreement is
unconditional over this code, while the left-hand side fails by hypothesis.

The `∀ P` is carried by the right-hand side being true here, not by an argument about `P`. What
makes the statement land on the intended target is that the correlated-agreement error, whose bad
event is `close ∧ ¬ jointAgreement`, *does* satisfy the equivalence at every threshold.

The forward implication for `mcaError` — a bound gives the threshold statement — is [BCGM25]
Lemma 3.22 and is not formalized here. -/
