# Unique-decoding witnesses for the Grand MCA Challenge

`GrandChallenges/CapacityBounds.lean` builds `McaLowerWitness`es from the capacity-regime
catalogue, every entry of which is an external admit. This module builds one from [BCIKS20]'s
unique-decoding-regime bound instead, which is proved in-tree.

## Main definition

- `McaLowerWitness.ofUniqueDecodingRange` — a one-sided Grand MCA Challenge witness for a
  Reed-Solomon code at any positive radius up to the relative unique-decoding radius, valid
  whenever `n / |F|` clears the requested threshold.

## Why this one is different

It is the first `McaLowerWitness` constructor in the tree whose numeric input is proved rather
than admitted: `McaLowerWitness.ofJohnsonRangeBound` rests on `rs_mcaError_le_in_johnson_range`,
an external [BCHKS25] admit, whereas this rests on `rs_mcaError_le_of_le_relUDR`, which is
axiom-clean.

The trade is radius for provenance. [BCIKS20] only reaches half the minimum distance, well short
of the Johnson radius the challenge cares about, and its `n / |F|` is a factor `n` weaker than
[BCHKS25] Theorem 1.3 in the overlapping range. So this constructor is not a route to the prize
thresholds — at `ε* = 2^-128` it demands `|F| ≥ n · 2^128`. It is the honest floor: what the
challenge API can currently certify with no admit anywhere beneath it.

/-- Builds a one-sided MCA witness from [BCIKS20]'s unique-decoding-regime bound: at any positive
radius `δ` up to the relative unique-decoding radius of the Reed-Solomon code, the affine-line MCA
error is at most `n / |F|`, so any threshold `ε_star` that `n / |F|` clears is witnessed.

Unlike `McaLowerWitness.ofJohnsonRangeBound`, nothing below this constructor is admitted. -/
