# Exact capacity lists at every rate

This module assembles all mathematical list bounds accompanying [DKTZ26, Theorem 1.1].
`HasCapacityLists` spells out the common exact-list property. `CapacityListBounds` collects
the quantitative conclusions, led by the field-independent bound of Corollary A.7.
The capacity gap is fixed before the block length, dimension,
prime field, evaluation points, and received word. The statement includes both
field-size regimes and uses ordinary polynomial degree, including the zero polynomial.

This module proves list existence and cardinality, not an executable decoder or running time.
The exact decoder specification is in `ReedSolomon/Decoding/Specification`.

## Decoding procedure and formalization scope

The hidden-derivative algorithm chooses interpolation parameters and an ambient message dimension,
solves the homogeneous local-contact constraints for a nonzero differential polynomial, enumerates
its bounded-degree polynomial solutions by separant descent and regular Taylor lifting, and filters
by the original degree and agreement thresholds. The interpolation and solution-counting results
below justify the list bounds. This branch does not package those steps as an executable
decoder, and makes no operation-count or bit-complexity claim. Classical finite-set extraction in
the theorem is not a claim of efficient enumeration.

## Decoding regimes

Capacity is the fixed-gap regime `1 - k / n - δ`, uniformly over all message dimensions.
This extends the low-rate hidden-derivative result of [BCPZZ26]. It is distinct from
unique decoding (`CodingTheory/BerlekampWelch`) and Johnson-radius interpolation
(`CodingTheory/GuruswamiSudan`). Those are separate developments, not assumptions here.
Field-independent geometric list bounds are in `ListDecodability/Capacity/GeometricBound`.
Mutual correlated agreement at capacity is in `CorrelatedAgreement/Capacity` and
`CorrelatedAgreement/Capacity`; list cardinality and MCA are different properties.

/-! ## The paper-facing property and its quantitative instantiation

The property below separates the meaning of an exact capacity list from the numerical
bound one proves for it. Its bound argument can express several simultaneous estimates.
The final theorem instantiates it with `CapacityListBounds`, so every estimate applies
to the same exact list, not to separately chosen candidate families.

/-- Minimum block length: one at gaps at least `1/4`, and `8m` for smaller gaps.
Here `m = asymmetricBandMultiplicity δ = ⌈100 d² H_(d-1)⌉`, where
`d = capacityDerivativeOrder δ` and `H_r = ∑_{i=1}^r 1/i` is the harmonic number.
In the small-gap regime, `d = ⌈exp(6.76 / δ)⌉`. The multiplicity formula is used
only in that regime; gaps at least `1/4` have length threshold one. -/

  if (1 / 4 : ℝ) ≤ δ then 1 else 8 * asymmetricBandMultiplicity δ

/-- Field-independent list bound. At small gaps it is `4m²(4m/δ)^d n^d`;
at gaps at least `1/4` we use `n`, with strict inequality proved separately.
The derivative order `d` and multiplicity `m` depend only on the gap. -/

/-- Exact list decodability at a fixed gap, uniformly over prime fields and code rates.

`bounds n k q A ℓ` is a property of the list cardinality `ℓ`; it is not an assumption
on the received word. Supplying a different bound does not change the exact-list contract.
This is a mathematical property, with no executable algorithm or cost model. -/

/-- **Capacity lists at every rate, with all prescribed list bounds.**

Fix any gap `0 < δ < 1`. The threshold, derivative order, and multiplicity depend only
on that gap. `HasCapacityLists` gives the exact agreement list for every admissible code
and received word; `CapacityListBounds` gives the field-independent bound and both
finite-field refinements, together with the quarter-gap and half-gap conclusions.

This is the mathematical list portion of [DKTZ26, Theorem 1.1], including Corollary A.7.
It does not certify the separate decoder or running-time assertion. -/
