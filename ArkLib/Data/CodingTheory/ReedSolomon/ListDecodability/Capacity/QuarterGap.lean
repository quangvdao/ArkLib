# Reed-Solomon list bounds at gaps of at least one quarter

This module proves list bounds for capacity gaps at least one quarter. The proof is the
elementary agreement-counting argument from [DKTZ26]: distinct degree-`< k` Reed--Solomon words
agree in at most `k - 1` positions, and the exact Cauchy--Schwarz estimate from
`Code.card_mul_sq_minAgreement_sub_pairAgreement_le` bounds every finite high-agreement family.

For gaps at least one half, two candidates would agree in at least `k` positions and hence the list
has size at most one. For gaps between one quarter and one half, the identity

`(k + n / 4)^2 - n * (k - 1) = (k - n / 4)^2 + n`

gives list size at most `n - k + 1`, which is strictly less than `n` when `k ≥ 2`.
For `k = 1`, distinct constant messages have disjoint agreement sets and the threshold is at
least two, again giving strictly fewer than `n` candidates. This declarative proof supplies no
interpolation algorithm or running-time claim.
