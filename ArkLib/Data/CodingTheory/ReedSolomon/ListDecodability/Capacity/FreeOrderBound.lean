# Qualitative all-rate Reed--Solomon list bounds

The generic theorem in this module turns any uniform family of actual hidden-derivative
constructions into the canonical all-rate polynomial-list contract. The concrete theorem combines
the elementary quarter-gap certificate with the prescribed no-band weighted-support certificate.
Oversized agreement thresholds yield empty lists without requiring an impossible interpolant.

The finite-set decoder is a classical witness, not a polynomial-time implementation. The
paper-facing quantitative list theorem is in `Capacity.lean`; the generic transformer here remains
available to alternative uniform families of interpolation witnesses.
