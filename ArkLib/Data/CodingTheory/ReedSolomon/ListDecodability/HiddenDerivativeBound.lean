# Pointwise list bounds from a hidden-derivative interpolant

This file connects the canonical set of agreeing Reed--Solomon message polynomials to differential
root counting.  A target polynomial retains its original strict degree bound while the generic
embedding places it in an ambient degree bound `D`.  The final theorem instantiates `D = K - 1`
from `messageDim ≤ K`.

The first theorem packages each agreeing polynomial as a bounded solution of the exact interpolant.
The cardinality adapters then compare the canonical point list directly with the bounded-solution
type.  The final theorem applies the unconditional differential root count.  It makes no claim
about computing the list or the running time of a decoder.
