# Finiteness and an incidence bound for Reed--Solomon agreement lists

Over an arbitrary field, the degree-`< k` polynomials agreeing with a received
word in at least `A ≥ k` positions form a finite set.  Double-counting their
`k`-element agreement samples gives the elementary bound
`list.card * A.choose k ≤ n.choose k`.

This is a supporting field-independent incidence estimate, not the all-rate list
size bound.
