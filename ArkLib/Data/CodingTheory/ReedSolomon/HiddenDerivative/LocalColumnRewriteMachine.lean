# Charged local U expansion and contact projection

Structured recursive instructions expand each U factor into E and the d signed visible-jet
summands. Every coordinate increment, branch allocation, append, predicate test and scalar sign
operation is explicit. Each recursion clause has an upper charge of 32 primitive units, plus the
charges of its executed recursive calls. This includes call/return control, natural operations,
scalar negation/addition, pointer/cell accesses and allocations. Shared tails are immutable.
No list map/filter/append/modify or polynomial primitive is used by the executable definitions.
Garbage collection and arithmetic bit costs are outside this unit-operation model.

Final dense terms have layout [T,E,Y1,...,Yd]. Duplicate exponent vectors and zero coefficients
are retained. Full-vector equality and duplicate-aware lookup are separately charged.
