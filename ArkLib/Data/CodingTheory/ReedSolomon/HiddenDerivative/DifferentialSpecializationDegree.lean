# Specialization degree of exact interpolation polynomials

This file joins the exact interpolation support inequality to the generic differential-
specialization degree theorem.  Every polynomial represented by the exact coefficient space has
specialization degree strictly below `m * A` at every polynomial of degree at most `D`.

The exact support predicate and its `(1, D, D - 1, ..., D - d)` weighted-degree consequence are
proved in `InterpolationIndex.lean`.  The generic specialization estimate is proved in
`RootFinding/SpecializationDegree.lean`; that proof is the coefficient-ring-general form of the
authorized `kz99/rs-ld-mca` donor argument in
`RSListDecoding/Lemmas/GlobalBudgets.lean`, at commit
`9699ee7a6143f6efe1d8cfed84998a4f8c79c40f`.  The two integration theorems below are
ArkLib-specific adapters, not a further donor port.
