# Explicit length-one and length-two order-zero branches

A positive gap makes the length-one threshold impossible. At length two, multiplicity one
has strict finite column surplus and the actual direct attempt succeeds. These are branch
certificates for the outer driver, not an implementation of that driver's runtime branching.
The public N=1 convention is unchanged, and characteristic premises remain explicit.
