# Polynomial local-rewrite cost at derivative order zero

At order zero the hidden variable expands only to E: no visible-jet branches are generated.
Every expansion round preserves the number of terms, so its repeated execution is linear in
the exponent rather than exponential. These bounds apply to the existing executable program,
including growing multiplicity. They remove the spurious exponential constant from the local
part of the large-gap interpolation route; matrix and solver cost composition are separate.
