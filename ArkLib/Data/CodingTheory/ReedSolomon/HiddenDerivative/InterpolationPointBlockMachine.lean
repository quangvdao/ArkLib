# Materialized interpolation rows for one received point

The program enumerates actual support columns, executes each translated/reduced column, collects
all emitted exponent vectors as a redundant row frame, and allocates homogeneous augmented rows
by duplicate-aware coefficient lookup. There is no matrix-entry callback. Collecting the actual
vectors avoids a separate exponent-box coverage assumption. Duplicate rows and zero terms remain.

Every recursive clause charges 32 primitive units for control, pointer/register operations,
natural tests, scalar constants, and allocations, plus every executed callee charge. Exponent
vectors are shared immutable tails; copying an outer list cell is charged. Bit costs, garbage
collection and host fuel administration are outside this unit-operation model.
