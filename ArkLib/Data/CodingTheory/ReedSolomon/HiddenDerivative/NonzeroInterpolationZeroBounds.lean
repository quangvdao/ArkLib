# Polynomial observed cost of order-zero interpolation attempts

The same support, matrix, solver and sparse conversion execute unchanged. The order-zero row
bound replaces the generic exponential estimate, including on genuine no-kernel failures.
These bounds allow growing multiplicity. Success from large-gap parameters still requires an
actual eligible witness; a mathematical list-cardinality bound alone does not supply one.
The missing witness route also needs triangular image/rank counting and the D=0 boundary.
Multiplicity n+1 would not ensure below-characteristic jet degree under q≥n; any large-gap
construction must resolve that requirement without changing the field or block-length regime.
