# Exhibited kernel factors for the enlarged local constraint map

Let

```text
E♯ = U - localJetSum.
```

The point-independent rewrite sends `E♯` to the error variable `E`.  Consequently every
multiple of `T^r (E♯)^h` lies in the kernel of the enlarged low-contact map as soon as
`m ≤ r + d*h`.  This file proves that statement over an arbitrary commutative ring and proves
that multiplication by the displayed factor is injective over a field.

At the canonical threshold `h = contactThreshold d m r`, these maps are the algebraic core of the
paper's exhibited `K_r` spaces.  The present slice deliberately does not yet assert that their
bounded ranges lie inside the finite intermediate space, that different `r`-ranges form a direct
sum, or that the resulting residual count is the rank of the enlarged map.  Those are the
remaining `I3`/`I4` support and finite-dimensional linear-algebra obligations.
