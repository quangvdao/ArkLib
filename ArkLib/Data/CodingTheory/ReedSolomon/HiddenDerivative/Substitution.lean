# Structured hidden-derivative substitutions

This file separates the two algebraic changes of variables in the hidden-derivative argument.

First,

```text
X   = alpha + T,
Y₀  = y + T U,
Y_j = Y_j                         (1 ≤ j ≤ d).
```

Then

```text
U = E + sum_{j=1}^d (-1)^(j+1) T^(j-1) Y_j.
```

Their composition is the unscaled local substitution, in which `E` denotes the candidate-derived
backward Taylor error and occurs as `T E`.  The normalized substitution additionally sends
`E` to `T^d E`, so its free error occurs as `T^(d+1) E`.

The definitions rework the sound algebraic material from ArkLib commit `d3370654`, while exposing
the intermediate `U` map needed by the later local-rank factorization.  The global variables are
the `JetVariable` type; the old proof-hole-bearing merge stack is not imported.
