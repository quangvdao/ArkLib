# Boundary canaries for local contact

These examples exercise the two boundary cases used by the local-contact proof.  Order zero has
no low-contact coefficients even though the auxiliary variable also has weight zero.  The
characteristic-two example has local form `T * E`, so its exact contact order is `1 + 1 = 2`; its
canonical differential specialization is the nonzero polynomial `(X - 1)^2`.
