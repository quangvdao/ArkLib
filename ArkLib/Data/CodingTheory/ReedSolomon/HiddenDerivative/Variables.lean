# Local variables and weights for hidden-derivative interpolation

This file names the variables used after translating a differential polynomial to an agreement
point.  The shared auxiliary slot is called `U` before the hidden-derivative rewrite and `E`
afterward:

* `localT d` is the displacement variable `T`;
* `localU d = localE d` is the auxiliary/error slot;
* `localY j` represents the visible jet variable `Y_(j+1)`.

The contact weight of `T^i E^b` is `i + d*b`.  The local anisotropic weight assigns weight `j`
to zero-based `localY j`, matching weight `(j+1)-1` on the paper variable `Y_(j+1)`.

The definitions rework the sound algebraic part of ArkLib commits `1b827589`, `71214c68`, and
`d3370654`.  They deliberately use the `JetVariable` API from
`HiddenDerivative.InterpolationSpace`, rather than reintroducing the incompatible inductive
global-variable type from that earlier stack.  No theorem from the proof-hole-bearing merge
commits `3feac154` or `07cf41c1` is used.
