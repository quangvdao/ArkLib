# Polynomial differential equations in finite Hasse jets

This file defines the root-finding interface for a polynomial relation in `X` and the finite
Hasse jet `Y₀, ..., Y_d`. It separates three operations that later root-counting proofs must not
conflate:

* `differentialSpecialization` substitutes a genuine polynomial and its Hasse derivatives;
* `jetEvaluation` evaluates the formal variables at one scalar jet;
* `separant` formally differentiates in a selected jet variable.

The derivative order uses `JetVariable d = Option (Fin (d + 1))` from the interpolation layer:
`none` denotes `X`, while `some j` denotes `Y_j`. The root-finding characteristic conditions are
packaged separately from cardinality conditions because passing to a larger extension field does
not increase the characteristic.
