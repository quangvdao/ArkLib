# Materialized received-point interpolation matrices

The input is a materialized list of received point/value pairs and a supplied ambient D. Actual
support enumeration and a charged cell count determine the common width, even on empty input.
Each point executes the proved point-block assembler; row counting and concatenation visit and
charge every copied cell. Counters record the actual point and row counts. No list length,
flatten, or matrix-entry callback is executed. Point order and support-column order are preserved.

Each recursive clause charges 32 primitive units plus its executed callees. These cover control,
scalar-input reads, natural counter updates, cursor/register accesses, and result allocation.
List tails are shared immutably. Bit costs, garbage collection and host fuel are outside this
unit-operation model. The initial support enumeration is additional to each point's enumeration.
