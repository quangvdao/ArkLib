# Global multiplicity for hidden-derivative specialization

This file connects the generic distinct-root multiplicity bound to differential specialization.
If a specialization has contact of order `multiplicity` at at least `requiredPoints` distinct
evaluation points and its natural degree is strictly below `multiplicity * requiredPoints`, then
it vanishes identically.

The local-contact and specialization-degree layers supply the two polynomial hypotheses in the
final interpolation theorem. Keeping their composition separate here leaves the root-counting
argument independent of the definitions used to obtain local contact and the degree budget.

/-- A differential specialization vanishes when it has enough distinct roots of uniform
multiplicity for its strict natural-degree budget. The evaluation map need only be injective on
the selected agreement indices, whose actual cardinality may exceed `requiredPoints`. -/

/-- An exact interpolation polynomial that satisfies every local constraint vanishes after
differential specialization at any bounded-degree polynomial agreeing with the received word on
at least `A` selected indices. Only the selected evaluation points must be distinct, and the
selected set may contain more than `A` indices. -/
