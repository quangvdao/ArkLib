# Certified actual order-zero interpolation output

The direct attempt includes D=0 and has polynomial observed work even with growing multiplicity.
Every degree and characteristic assertion below concerns the polynomial reconstructed from the
actual returned coefficient vector. The existence witness is used only to force successful
execution. The outer prepared decoder must consume this direct attempt instead of ambient search,
whose lower endpoint excludes D=0; its root solver need not be duplicated.
