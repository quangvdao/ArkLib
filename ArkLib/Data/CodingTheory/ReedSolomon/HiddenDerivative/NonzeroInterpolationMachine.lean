# Actual nonzero interpolation solver and sparse emission

The program retains an actually enumerated support, constructs the received matrix, executes the
nonzero-kernel solver using its materialized dimensions, and traverses support and coefficients
together. Each nonzero coefficient allocates its variable-index/exponent pairs explicitly in
order [X,Y0,...,Yd]. Zero coefficients are tested and skipped. No coefficient oracle, symbolic
polynomial, free list length or list map is executed. Solver fuel is the existing function of
materialized row/column counters. The theorem budgets below are proof-side bounds only.

Recursive conversion and composition clauses charge 32 primitive operations plus every executed
callee charge. This includes field equality, natural index updates, data accesses and allocation.
The scalar-field input, arithmetic bit costs, and inherited host-fuel administration remain
outside this unit-operation model.
