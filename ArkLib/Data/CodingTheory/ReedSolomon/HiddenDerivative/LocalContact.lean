# Local contact and root multiplicity

This file turns the low-contact coefficient constraints at an agreement point into a root of
multiplicity `m` of the canonical differential specialization.  A local monomial `T^i E^b Y^e`
has contact order `i + d * b`.  Under the actual-polynomial interpretation, `T` becomes `X` and
the hidden error is divisible by `X^d`, so every surviving monomial contributes the required
power of `X`.  Taylor translation then returns the centered factor `(X - C center)^m`.

The monomial divisibility argument is adapted, with permission, from Kai Zhe Zheng's
`rs-ld-mca` formalization at commit `9699ee7a6143f6efe1d8cfed84998a4f8c79c40f`, file
`RSListDecoding/Lemmas/Contact.lean`.  Its composition with ArkLib's canonical differential
specialization and local-constraint map is new.
