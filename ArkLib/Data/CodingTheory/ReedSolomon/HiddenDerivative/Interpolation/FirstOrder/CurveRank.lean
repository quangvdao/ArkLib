# First-order rank bounds for polynomial received curves

The first-order constraint-rank theorem holds over every field. At the origin, the local map
splits into homogeneous blocks indexed by total jet degree, counting the error variable `E` as
degree one. This file defines each profile entry as the dimension of the actual block image.
Thus the profile records upper bounds coming from the constraint map itself; it does not assert
that a preselected numerical budget equals a rank.

Applying the aggregate theorem over `F(Z)` still controls polynomial received curves. The
received polynomials may have any degree: batching degree affects coefficient heights, while
the base-field graded images determine how many projected rows are needed at each degree.
