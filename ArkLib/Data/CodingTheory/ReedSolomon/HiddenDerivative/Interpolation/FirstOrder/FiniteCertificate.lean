# A finite first-order symbolic certificate from executable counts

This module removes the remaining choice of source columns from first-order symbolic
interpolation. It uses the canonical enumeration of every monomial

```text
X^x Y₀^a Y₁^b,  b ≤ M,  a + b ≤ μ,
                    x + D a + (D - 1) b < m A
```

and applies the degree-one specialization of the shifted graded-row engine.

## Reading the statements

The main theorem takes only the mathematical parameters, an embedding of the `n`
evaluation centers, the two received words defining `f + Zg`, and the strict numeric
inequality

```text
firstOrderCurveShiftedRowSlotBound D A m M μ n 1 h
  < firstOrderCurveShiftedHeightSlotCount D A m M μ 1 h.
```

There is no caller-supplied matrix rank, column family, or support-membership proof.
The result contains one primitive polynomial `Q` over `F[Z]`, chosen before any extension
field, challenge, agreement set, or candidate polynomial. Every candidate of degree below
`k` that agrees with `f + zg` at at least `A` positions satisfies the specialized
differential identity.

## Proof route and scope

The received line is viewed as a degree-one polynomial curve. The curve constructor supplies the
compressed graded matrix, primitive kernel, finite-support bounds, local constraints, and
extension-field soundness, and this module packages the result in the line certificate structure.

These theorems construct the interpolation equation and prove its agreement implication.
They do not count solutions of that equation or establish a final list-size or
correlated-agreement bound.
