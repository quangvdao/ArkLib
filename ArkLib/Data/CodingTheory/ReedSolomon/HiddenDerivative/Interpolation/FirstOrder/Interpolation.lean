# A nonzero first-order interpolant from a finite dimension surplus

Interpolation imposes homogeneous linear conditions on the coefficients of `Q`.
If the support has `N` monomials and each of `n` received points imposes at most `r`
independent conditions, `n*r < N` leaves a nonzero solution. This module proves that
argument for the actual hidden-derivative constraints and the capped first-order
support, rather than for an abstract matrix supplied by the caller.

## Reading the statements

* `D`, `A`, `m`, `M`, and `μ` have the meaning given in `FirstOrder.Basic`.
* `ι` indexes the received points; `centers i` and `received i` are their coordinates.
  No distinctness assumption is needed for interpolation itself. Distinct centers
  become necessary when adding root multiplicities in a later root-count argument.
* `firstOrderLocalConstraintAt` is the existing local constraint map restricted to
  this support. Its kernel expresses the multiplicity conditions at one point.
* `firstOrderGlobalConstraint` combines all those maps. The rank bound is
  `Fintype.card ι * certifiedEnlargedRankBound 1 m M 0`.
* `hdim` is a strict numerical surplus, not an assumption that an interpolant exists.
  The existential conclusion supplies one nonzero `Q` satisfying all the constraints.

The field is arbitrary. The hypothesis `1 < D` is needed by the reused exact-support
rank theorem, not by the linear algebra. The bound currently used here is the envelope
rank: it does not exploit the total-degree cap or specialization cutoff to reduce rank.

## Why the constraints are sound

The support embeds into the exact first-order interpolation space, so restriction
cannot increase its certified local rank. Map the global range into the product of
local ranges to obtain the sum bound, then apply rank--nullity. The final corollary
uses the contact theorem: if `P` agrees at a received point, specializing `Q` at `P`
is divisible by `(X - center)^m`. This step is valid in every characteristic because
the construction uses Hasse derivatives.

The first existence theorem chooses `Q` using only the received data. It can therefore
be applied to every candidate `P`; it is not necessary to re-interpolate for each
candidate. This is a fixed-received-word theorem. The challenge-degree bound required
for symbolic interpolation of an entire received line is a further construction.
