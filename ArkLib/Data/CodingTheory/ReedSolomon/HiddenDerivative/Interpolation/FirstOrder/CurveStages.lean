# Regular-stage coverage for finite first-order curve certificates

Interpolation constructs one equation before the challenge is sampled. Separant descent
then replaces its possibly singular solutions by regular solutions of a finite sequence
of equations. A single terminal obstruction accounts for all exceptional challenges in
this descent, with cardinality at most the original interpolation height.

## Reading the statements

The input is the actual finite curve certificate. Its nonvanishing and degree bounds are
derived from its fields. In positive characteristic only the total jet-degree cap enters
the descent condition; the challenge height can be larger than the characteristic.

The exceptional set is chosen before the candidate and its agreement positions, uniformly
over the supplied extension field. Outside it, every sufficiently agreeing candidate is
a regular root of one of the actual stages. Counting the regular roots and recovering
correlated tuples are the subsequent geometric steps.
