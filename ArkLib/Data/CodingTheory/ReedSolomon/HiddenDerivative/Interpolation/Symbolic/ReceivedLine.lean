# Symbolic received-line interpolation

The concrete local-constraint matrix retains the line challenge as a polynomial variable.
Finite support reduction handles its infinite row index without assuming a finite local
contact space. An actual rank bound gives a primitive polynomial kernel, whose assembled
interpolant remains nonzero after every field-extension and challenge specialization.
