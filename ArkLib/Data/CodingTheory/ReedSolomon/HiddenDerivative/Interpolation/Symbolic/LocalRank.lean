# Point independence of the weighted-support local rank

Translation in the global `X` and `Y₀` variables preserves the weighted support.  The local
constraint at an arbitrary point is therefore the zero-point constraint precomposed with a
linear automorphism of the support, so its actual rank is independent of the point.
