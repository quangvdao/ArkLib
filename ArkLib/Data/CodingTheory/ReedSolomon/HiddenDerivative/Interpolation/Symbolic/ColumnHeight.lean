# Symbolic received-line interpolation with column-sensitive height

In a source monomial `X^x Y₀^a Y₁^b`, the received-line challenge enters through
translation of `Y₀`. Its column in the actual constraint matrix therefore has
challenge degree at most `a`. Giving every column the largest degree loses this
information. Instead, at a trial height `h`, allow that column `h+1-a` coefficients,
or none if `a > h`.

The strict inequality below compares these unknown scalar coefficients with the
`n*r*(h+1)` scalar equations. It yields a primitive interpolant whose challenge
height is at most `h`, satisfying all the received-line constraints identically.
Primitive normalization ensures that it stays nonzero at every challenge, including
challenges in extension fields.

## Reading the statement

* `columns` are distinct source monomials. Their `y₀` exponents provide the weights.
* `hrank` bounds the rank of the actual constraint matrix over the rational function
  field. It is a separate mathematical input, not the number of rows in its raw encoding.
* `hheight` is precisely the finite column-height test. Equal weights may be grouped
  into the manuscript's multiplicities `N_a` without changing the sum.
* `v` is the polynomial coefficient vector; `interpolant columns v` assembles `Q`.
* The last conclusion supplies the actual local constraints. To infer differential
  identities on close polynomials, also establish the support's weighted-degree cutoff.

This theorem is independent of derivative order and support shape. It therefore belongs
with symbolic interpolation, while finite first-order support counts belong in `FirstOrder`.
