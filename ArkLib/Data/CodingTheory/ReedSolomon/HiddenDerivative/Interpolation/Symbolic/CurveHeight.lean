# Scaling the finite interpolation-height certificate for polynomial curves

Replacing a received line by a degree-`ℓ` curve multiplies each column's challenge-degree
budget by `ℓ`. The height `H = ℓ(h+1)-1` preserves the strict finite dimension comparison:
every column contribution and the row budget scale by exactly `ℓ`.
This is the arithmetic height transfer, not construction of a symbolic interpolant.
