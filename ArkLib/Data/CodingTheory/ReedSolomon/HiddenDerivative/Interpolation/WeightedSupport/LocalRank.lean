# Local rank for the no-band weighted support

Local substitution preserves higher-jet weight and contact order. The remaining ordinary
jet degree bounds each first-derivative exponent separately for its higher-jet tuple.
Counting these residual coordinates bounds the actual image in every characteristic.
