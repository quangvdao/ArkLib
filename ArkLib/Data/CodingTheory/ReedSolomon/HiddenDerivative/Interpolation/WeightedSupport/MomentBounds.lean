# Finite estimates for the centered simplex moments

Once simplex integration supplies the moment identities, their estimates are elementary real
inequalities. This module isolates that arithmetic from integration: the variance uses a lower
bound on the second harmonic sum, and the third moment uses upper harmonic bounds.
The identities themselves are separate obligations; these lemmas do not assume a probability
model or claim to construct one.
