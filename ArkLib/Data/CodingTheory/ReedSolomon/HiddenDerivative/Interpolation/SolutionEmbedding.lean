# Embedding agreeing polynomials into bounded differential solutions

An interpolation certificate makes every sufficiently agreeing message polynomial a root of its
differential interpolant. This module packages that polynomial, unchanged, as a bounded solution
at the certificate's ambient degree. The construction is independent of how the interpolation
support was chosen, so both qualitative and weighted-support list bounds use the same embedding.
