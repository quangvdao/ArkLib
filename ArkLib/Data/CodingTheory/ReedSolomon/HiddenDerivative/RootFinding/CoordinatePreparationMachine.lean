# Coordinate jet preparation

The cursor reverses the supplied jet and pads each missing entry with an explicitly materialized
pair of base zeros. Both zero literals and pair slots are charged. Capacity failure and tagged
output remain executable branches; no length, reversal or padding specification runs here.
