# Regular witnesses at actual ordered chain records

First-nonzero separant witnesses align with the exact sparse records emitted by the closed chain.
Under the specialization-degree field-size condition, every bounded root has a regular record
at some center, and solves every earlier record. No root enumeration or executable oracle is added.
