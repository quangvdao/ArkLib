# Executable iteration of regular coefficient lifting

This file iterates the executable one-coefficient regular lift.  Starting from a centered
polynomial containing the prescribed coefficients through degree `r`, stage `k` tests every field
element as the coefficient added in centered degree `k + r`.  Only candidates whose residual
coefficient at degree `k` vanishes survive.

The iteration result carries the exact number of field coefficients tested by those filters.  The
public solution list additionally checks the final residual and degree bound.  The latter check is
needed when `D < r`, where no lift stage runs and the supplied prefix need not itself have degree at
most `D`.
