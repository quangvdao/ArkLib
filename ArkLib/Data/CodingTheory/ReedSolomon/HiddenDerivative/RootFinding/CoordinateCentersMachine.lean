# Coordinate root enumeration across centers

Each supplied center runs the actual coordinate all-jet machine with a retained input record.
Candidate records and their outer cells are allocated separately. Explicit reversal preserves
center and jet order, including duplicates. All payload and child instruction costs are retained.
