# Coordinate regular lifting loop

Each stage constructs and retains the four-field direct input, executes that actual child, and
passes its materialized gamma to the actual indexed update. Counters and shared sample roots
persist across stages. Every child instruction retains its ledger plus outer dispatch/root work;
input construction and successful option allocation are explicit. The initial vector and samples
are supplied. Full residual acceptance, input preparation, interpreter and bit time are excluded.
