# Direct regular coefficient solving

The next residual coefficient is affine for positive lift order. Evaluating it at zero and one
recovers its intercept and slope, so a nonzero slope gives the unique coefficient by division.
The executable solver requires no finite-field enumeration. `none` means that this nonzero-slope
method is unavailable, not that the equation has no solutions.

This is a functional optimization of the exhaustive scan. The concrete residual evaluations still
use polynomial operations whose closed operational cost adequacy is open. No runtime or total
field-operation bound is claimed here.
