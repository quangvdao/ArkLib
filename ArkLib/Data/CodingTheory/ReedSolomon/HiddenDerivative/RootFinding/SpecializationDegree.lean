# Degree bounds for differential specialization

This file proves the weighted-degree bound used to control the exceptional witness points in
differential root counting.  If `P` has degree at most `D`, substituting
`X, P, P⁽¹⁾, ..., P⁽ᵈ⁾` into a differential polynomial cannot produce a univariate degree
larger than the weight that assigns `1` to `X` and `D - j` to `Y_j`.

The proof is the coefficient-field-general form of the argument in the authorized
`kz99/rs-ld-mca` source file `RSListDecoding/Lemmas/GlobalBudgets.lean`, pinned in the project
provenance record.  It is included here from first principles rather than relying on the source's
prime-field-specific statement.
