# Cap-sensitive first-order differential list counting

For a first-order differential equation of total jet degree at most `μ`, whose degree in `Y₁`
is at most `M`, a separant chain can select the top jet at most `M` times. At total degree
`j`, an order-zero stage costs `j`; an order-one stage costs

```text
j (1 + τ (j - 1)) (n - k + 1) / (A - k + 1).
```

`firstOrderTightListWeight n A k τ μ M` sums these charges, assigning the order-one
charge to the highest `min(M, μ)` stages. The main theorem accepts any sufficient Taylor
exponent `τ`, so concrete applications can use the first-order exponent `2 K - 3`.

## Reading the main theorem

* `Q` is any nonzero differential equation in `X,Y₀,Y₁` with the two degree caps.
  `S` is a finite set of degree-`< k` solutions, each agreeing with `received` at at least
  `A` distinct centers supplied by `domain`.
* `K` is the Taylor cutoff. The hypotheses `1 < K`, `k ≤ K`, and `K ≤ n` discharge
  the Taylor and binomial-pivot conditions; `τ` must suffice for both active orders.
* The field may have characteristic zero. In positive characteristic, the sufficient
  condition is `max n μ < ringChar F`.

## Proof route and scope

The proof follows one singular separant recursion. At a regular stage it restricts the
equation to its highest active jet and invokes the field-independent Taylor count. A `Y₁`
separant decreases the first-jet cap, while a stage headed by `Y₀` has no active `Y₁`.
Total jet degree drops at every singular step. Monotonicity of the recursive charge covers
skipped degrees and an early drop in active order.

The older `firstOrderListWeight` estimate follows by comparing charges with `τ = 2 K`
and replacing `n - k + 1` by `n`. It is a corollary of this same recursion.
The theorem bounds a supplied finite set; finiteness of the complete close-polynomial set
and transfers to interleavings or polynomial curves are separate results.
