# Deterministic direct regular lifting

Direct affine coefficient solves replace exhaustive field scans. The executable definitions require
no finite enumeration and retain only a single optional prefix. A final degree and full-residual
filter is essential: locally valid prefixes need not solve the full differential equation.

For a regular initial jet below the characteristic, the returned singleton or empty set equals the
existing complete exhaustive solver. This includes requested degrees below the initial jet order,
where no lift runs and the final degree check can reject the supplied prefix. Outside regularity,
`none` can also mean that a zero-slope affine solve was unavailable.

This is functional refinement only. Residual evaluation and polynomial operations still lack the
closed operational cost adequacy required for a lifting runtime theorem.
