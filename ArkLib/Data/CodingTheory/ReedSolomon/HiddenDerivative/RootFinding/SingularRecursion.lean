# Singular recursion for polynomial differential equations

This file formalizes the recursive-coverage seam in Kopparty's `SOLVE` procedure from
[Kop15, Theorem 4.3 and Section 4.2].  At an equation whose highest active jet is `Y_s`, a
solution is either singular, and hence also solves the separant equation, or its separant
specialization is a nonzero univariate polynomial.  In the latter case any point where that
polynomial is nonzero gives a regular Hasse jet.

Below the characteristic, the separant is nonzero, preserves every individual jet-degree bound,
and strictly decreases the sum of the individual jet degrees.  This supplies a well-founded
recursion.  The terminal equation has no active jet variables; if it is nonzero, it has no
bounded differential solution.

This is a coverage and termination interface, not an enumerator.  In particular, it does not
assert that a regular witness center exists.  The finite-field root count in the subsequent
root-finding layer must produce such a center from the nonzero separant specialization and an
explicit field-size bound.

The regular-lifting API pivots on the literal top coordinate `Fin.last r`.
`RootFinding.JetPrefix` supplies the companion adapter that restricts an arbitrary highest active
jet `s` to its active prefix before invoking that theorem.  No root count or enumeration is
claimed here.
