# Canonical sample order and global prefix checks

The separant X is zero at the first sample and nonzero at the next two. Only the first nonzero
sample is accepted. An unsolved earlier equation rejects even that canonical center.

-- Sample order, rather than alphabet order or an arbitrary regular center, selects center two.
example : accepted 0 [0, 2, 1]
    (⟨⟨⟨[(1, [(0, 1), (1, 1)])], some (1, 1)⟩, [], [(1, [(0, 1)])]⟩, 2, [0]⟩ : Record ℚ) =
      true := by decide +kernel

-- Center one is also regular but follows the first nonzero sample and is rejected.
example : accepted 0 [0, 2, 1]
    (⟨⟨⟨[(1, [(0, 1), (1, 1)])], some (1, 1)⟩, [], [(1, [(0, 1)])]⟩, 1, [0]⟩ : Record ℚ) =
      false := by decide +kernel

-- The zero sample is not a regular center for the supplied separant.
example : accepted 0 [0, 2, 1]

      false := by decide +kernel

-- The candidate zero fails an earlier constant-one identity, even at the canonical center.
example : accepted 0 [0, 2, 1]
    (⟨⟨⟨[(1, [(0, 1), (1, 1)])], some (1, 1)⟩, [[(1, [])]], [(1, [(0, 1)])]⟩,

-- Filtering preserves the record at the first nonzero sample and drops later regular centers.
example : selected 0 [0, 2, 1]

      ⟨⟨⟨[], some (1, 1)⟩, [], [(1, [(0, 1)])]⟩, 2, [0]⟩,
