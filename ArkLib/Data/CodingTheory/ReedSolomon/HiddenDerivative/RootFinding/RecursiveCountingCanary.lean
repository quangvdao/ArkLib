# Canaries for recursive separant counting

These examples distinguish the two sides of the separant partition.  For `Y₀² = 0`, the zero
polynomial is singular at the first stage and is transported to the `2Y₀ = 0` equation.  For
`Y₀ = 0`, the same polynomial is regular because the separant is the nonzero constant one.
Thus the examples reject swapping the regular and singular predicates or reversing the
descendant transport.
