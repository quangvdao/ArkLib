# Closed residual-zero canaries

The materialized polynomial is `P(T)=T` and the sparse equation selects `Y₀`. Thus the supplied
points are also the sampled values. Exact costs distinguish a nontrivial all-zero scan, early
rejection after one or two tests, and the final emission boundary. All batch work remains charged.
