# Base-instruction execution of the direct coefficient arithmetic tail

Only the local arithmetic phases are represented. Residual recovery, coefficient update and
lookup must deliver the two already materialized coordinate operands before this machine starts.
No residual callback or inherited residual cost is assumed. Negation, addition, equality, inverse
and product each suspend into the existing quadratic arithmetic instruction program.

Launch charges two control operations (phase selection and call setup) and ten data accesses
for operand/parameter reads, the three input registers and the saved continuation. The zero-test
also allocates two zero coordinates with two literal writes. Every child retains its complete
base ledger and a parent wrapper. Pair return charges one dispatch and five accesses; Boolean
return charges two dispatches and six accesses for branch selection and retained operands.
Immutable operands are shared. Host fuel, input preparation and bit costs remain outside scope.
