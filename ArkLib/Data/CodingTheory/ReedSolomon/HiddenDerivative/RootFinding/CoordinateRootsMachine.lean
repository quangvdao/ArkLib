# Coordinate candidate enumeration and acceptance

The actual scalar-free axes and Cartesian-product machines enumerate supplied coordinates.
Every jet is prepared by the coordinate padding machine and tested by the full coordinate root
machine. Candidates are saved and reversed explicitly, preserving order and duplicates. Each
root payload is retained with charged allocation; all child instructions and output are charged.
