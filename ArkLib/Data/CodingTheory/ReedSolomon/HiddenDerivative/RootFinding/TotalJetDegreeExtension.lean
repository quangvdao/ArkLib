# Extension-field witnesses with a total-jet-degree budget

Injective coefficient extension preserves the original equation's total jet degree. Counting
its solutions over an extension therefore bounds the base-field solutions by `2*Δ*q^(e*d)`
when half the witness field avoids the separant degree budget. No normalization is required.
