# Whole-candidate refinement of the regular lifting loop

A fixed physical width supplies every intermediate degree bound. The actual loop agrees with
functional direct lifting on the complete represented polynomial, including early failure.
Regularity identifies its result with the exhaustive prefix interface. Full residual acceptance
is deliberately separate: a completed prefix is not yet certified as a differential root.
