# Cap-sensitive sums along first-order separant chains

A first-order separant chain visits strictly decreasing positive total jet degrees. Its active
jet orders also decrease, and order one can be selected no more often than the initial exponent
of the first derivative. This file turns those structural facts into the sharp two-block sum used
by first-order agreement geometry.

## Reading the statement

Give an order-zero charge `c₀ j` and an order-one charge `c₁ j` for a stage of total jet
degree `j`. If both charges increase with `j`, are nonnegative, and `c₀ ≤ c₁`, then a chain
of total jet degree at most `μ` and first-derivative degree at most `M` costs no more than the
full schedule with `c₁` on the largest `min M μ` degrees and `c₀` on the rest.

The result is purely an aggregation theorem. Concrete joint and fiber degree formulas are supplied
by later geometry modules.
