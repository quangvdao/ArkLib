# Closed initial-jet preparation

A supplied ascending jet is reversed into a descending coefficient list while consuming the
explicit capacity `D+1`. A second loop prepends zeros to fill that capacity. Overlong inputs
are rejected, and success and failure are separately emitted. No list length, reversal, padding,
or polynomial primitive is executed. Leading zeros and an empty initial jet are supported.

The cost extends the jet machine's categories by counting scalar constants. Each padding zero,
list allocation, cursor access, capacity test/decrement, and the initial successor is charged.
Cell reads retrieve head and tail together; retained registers are shared. Input materialization,
host fuel bookkeeping and scalar bit costs remain outside the model.
