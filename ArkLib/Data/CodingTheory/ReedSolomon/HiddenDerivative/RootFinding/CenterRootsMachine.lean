# Closed root enumeration across all supplied centers

The shared alphabet is scanned as the center list. Each center runs the actual all-jet machine.
Successful global vectors are paired with their center and stored by separate pair/cell allocation
transitions. An explicit reversal preserves center and jet order. Duplicates across centers remain
for a subsequent canonical guard; field/sample preparation and outer stage loops are separate.
