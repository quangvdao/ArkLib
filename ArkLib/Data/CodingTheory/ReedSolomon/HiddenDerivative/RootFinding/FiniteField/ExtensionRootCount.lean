# Differential root counts at a chosen extension degree

This file keeps the individual jet-degree bound `t` in the prefactor and allows any positive
extension degree `e`. The resulting bound is `2 * (d + 1) * t^2 * |F|^(e*d)` when the extension
contains at least twice the weighted-degree budget. Thus degrees one and two give the desired
field-size exponents once `t` is bounded independently of the field size.

The prefactor is deliberately conservative: the existing singular recursion charges at most
`(d + 1) * t` branches, each with regular-jet cost `t`. This is not the sharper total-jet-degree
prefactor from the manuscript. The witness budget here bounds the original polynomial's weighted
degree, rather than the smaller first-separant degree. All regular-jet injectivity premises are
discharged by the proved below-characteristic lifting theorem. No enumeration or runtime claim
is made.
