# Finite witness counting for differential roots

This file isolates the finite double-counting step in differential root bounds. Given a relation
between roots and witnesses, a lower bound on the number of witnesses for each root and an upper
bound on the number of roots for each witness imply a bound on the total number of roots.

The root-finding specialization retains truncated natural subtraction in the factor `S - H`.
Consequently it does not need an assumption `H ≤ S`: when there are more exceptional points than
witness points, the lower bound degenerates safely to zero.

/-! ### Generic finite incidence counting -/

/-- Double-count a finite relation from uniform bounds on its two kinds of fibers.

Every element of `left` is related to at least `lower` elements of `right`, while every element of
`right` is related to at most `upper` elements of `left`. The conclusion follows by counting the
same incidence relation first over `left` and then over `right`. -/

/-! ### Coverage outside root-dependent bad sets -/

/-- Derive the incidence bound from a root-dependent set of bad witnesses.

For each root, at most `H` witnesses are bad and every available witness outside that bad set is
good. Bad sets may depend on the root and may contain elements outside `witnesses`; only their
cardinality is used. This is the form needed when bad witnesses are roots of a separant specialized
along the candidate solution. -/

/-! ### Root-and-witness specialization -/

/-- Division-free witness bound used by differential root counting.

There are at most `S` available witnesses. Every root has at least `S - H` good witnesses, and
each witness belongs to at most `Δ * S ^ d` roots. No comparison between `H` and `S` is required;
the natural subtraction makes the conclusion valid at the degenerate boundary `S ≤ H`. -/
