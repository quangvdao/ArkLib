# Scalar-sample refinement of the concrete residual

A centered prefix is sampled at `u`, but the differential equation's independent variable is
`center+u`. Under the ambient degree and strict weighted-degree budgets, `L` distinct samples
recover every residual coefficient through a Vandermonde solve. The same samples suffice for
the complete zero-residual check.

This connects the existing concrete residual to the proposed scalar-evaluation implementation;
sampling, coefficient preparation, and matrix solving still need executable costed consumers.
No regularity, characteristic, or rate assumption is hidden in these algebraic identities.
