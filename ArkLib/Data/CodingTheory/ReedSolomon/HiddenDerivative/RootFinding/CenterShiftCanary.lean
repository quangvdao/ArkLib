# Closed center-shift canaries

Kernel computations check the sign of the translation, descending output order, retained leading
zeros, final return, and degree zero. Every cost includes the separate negation field.

-- 3(X-2)² + 4(X-2) + 5 = 3X² - 8X + 9.
example : runFuel (⟨[3, 4, 5], 2, 2⟩ : Input ℤ) 46 .start =

-- The preparation callee has emitted, but the final outer return is still pending.

-- A leading zero remains a physical coefficient cell after shifting.
example : runFuel (⟨[0, 2, 3], 2, 2⟩ : Input ℤ) 46 .start =

-- Degree zero has one coefficient; even the zero center incurs the explicit negation charge.
example : runFuel (⟨[7], 0, 0⟩ : Input ℤ) 18 .start =
