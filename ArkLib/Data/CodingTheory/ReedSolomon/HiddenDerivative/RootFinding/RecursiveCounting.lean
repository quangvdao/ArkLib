# Counting through the singular separant recursion

This file supplies the cardinality-composition layer of Kopparty's `SOLVE` recursion from
[Kop15, Theorem 4.3 and Section 4.2].  At every equation in the deterministic separant chain,
the bounded solutions split into a regular part and a singular part.  The singular part embeds
injectively into the bounded solutions of the next separant equation.  Because the sum of the
individual jet degrees strictly decreases at each singular step, a uniform bound for every
regular part accumulates at most `jetDegreeMeasure Q` times.

The central theorem is deliberately conditional on a regular-branch counting inequality.  The
condition is the seam at which regular-jet uniqueness and finite-field witness counting enter;
this file neither assumes iterated lifting nor claims an executable solver.  Keeping the
inequality division-free also preserves the exact finite-field arithmetic used by the later
root-counting theorem.

/-- A uniform division-free cardinality budget for the regular part at every equation on the
canonical singular chain below `root`.

The quantifier over finite sets is intentional: recursive counting only needs the regular
solutions inherited from the caller's current finite set, rather than all bounded solutions in
the ambient type. -/

/-- A regular-branch inequality composes through the complete deterministic separant chain.

If every regular part costs at most `cost` after multiplication by `left`, then the original
finite solution set costs at most `jetDegreeMeasure Q * cost`.  The proof follows the computed
highest active jet, transports the singular filter injectively to the next equation, and recurses
using the strict `jetDegreeMeasure` decrease.  A nonzero terminal equation contributes no
solutions. -/
