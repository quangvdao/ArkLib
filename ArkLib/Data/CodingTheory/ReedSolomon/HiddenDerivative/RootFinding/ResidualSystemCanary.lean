# Residual-system composition boundaries

A nonzero center affects the sampled independent variable. Both point/value pairs become matrix
rows and undergo elimination; the final emitted equations have the expected coefficients and RHS.
The one-short execution retains the completed callee result rather than emitting it for free.
