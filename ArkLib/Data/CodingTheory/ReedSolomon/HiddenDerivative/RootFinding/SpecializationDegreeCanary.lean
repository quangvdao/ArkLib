# Canaries for differential-specialization degree

The main example attains the exact weighted bound: with ambient degree five, the monomial
`X² Y₁³` has weight `2 + 3(5-1) = 14`, and substituting `P = X⁵` produces a nonzero
degree-four first Hasse derivative and hence a polynomial of degree fourteen.
