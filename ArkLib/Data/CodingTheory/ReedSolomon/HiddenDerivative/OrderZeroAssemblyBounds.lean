# Polynomial matrix-block assembly cost at derivative order zero

The actual support enumeration and column program are unchanged. The order-zero column size
is at most m², so the materialized row count and assembly charge remain polynomial even when
m grows with the input. Exact kernel semantics are inherited from the same point-block program.
