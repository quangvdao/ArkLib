# Boundary canary for the exhibited local-constraint kernel

The generic kernel theorem says that contact order at least `m` is discarded.  This concrete
counter-boundary checks that contact order `3` is retained when `m = 5`; it would fail if the
strict projection boundary, the error weight, or the triangular rewrite were implemented in the
wrong direction.
