# Canaries for exact interpolation specialization degree

The zero-vector example pins the truncated natural-degree boundary.  The order-one example
reconstructs `X² Y₁³` from a single exact interpolation coefficient: with `P = X⁵`, its
specialization has degree fourteen, exactly the predecessor of the strict budget fifteen.
