# Reconstructing a message from a cubic anchored quotient

Two early evaluations and one later evaluation determine an interpolation polynomial of
degree below three. Multiplying the extracted quotient by the three linear factors and adding
that interpolant restores all three values. A quotient of degree below `k` produces a message
of degree below `k + 3`. This is the degree shift needed by the anchored LambdaVM list bound.

The lemmas apply to each column separately. They do not assume that the three points are distinct:
distinctness is needed to construct the interpolant, while reconstruction only uses its degree
and values. The agreement lemma connects a received quotient equation to the recovered message
at any evaluation position without dividing by a possibly zero field element.
