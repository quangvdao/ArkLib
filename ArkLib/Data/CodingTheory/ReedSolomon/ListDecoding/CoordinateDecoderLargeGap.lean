# Executed coordinate decoding for gaps at least one quarter

The literal order-zero interpolation dispatch, quadratic setup, and decoding driver return the
same exact list with a universal polynomial primitive-work bound. Multiplicity is allowed to
grow with the block length. Blocks of length at most two are handled separately by direct
decoding. This result does not assert the unfinished bit-RAM refinement.
