# Exact base outputs with restricted enumeration and separate recovery samples

The materialized enumeration alphabet is explicitly related to the embedded full base list.
The same list supplies guard witnesses; independent extension samples supply root recovery.
Output soundness comes directly from degree and agreement acceptance. Completeness uses the
actual interpolation certificate and a canonical regular base center, not guard-grid soundness.
