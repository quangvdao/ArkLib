# Batched bounded-fiber tower agreement recovery

This module is an adapter for `AgreementRecovery.Tower` that keeps each initial tower as the
common ancestor of its live descendants. At one received coordinate the ancestor residual is
formed once, then `TowerBatch.restrictBases` sends that same nested polynomial through one
product/remainder tree for the base moduli of all live descendants. Each descendant subsequently
performs its own fiber reduction and D5 zero/unit split.

The base batch therefore includes repeated moduli and does not assume that live descendants have
the same fiber polynomial. Stopped descendants are omitted from the product tree and keep their
recorded sample positions unchanged. The correctness companion proves refinement at the
observable recovered-message level; it deliberately does not claim an asymptotic cost bound.
