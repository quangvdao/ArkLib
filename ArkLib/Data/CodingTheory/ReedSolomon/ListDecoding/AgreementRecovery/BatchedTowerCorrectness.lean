# Correctness of batched tower agreement recovery

The executable row operation in `BatchedTower` uses one product tree for the common ancestor
residual. The first part of this file proves that the ordered batch is exactly the collection scan
whose per-component residual is the corresponding canonical base restriction followed by local
fiber reduction. The second part proves the same represented-family exactness contract as the
existing tower scan.

Because the two scans may partition their internal tower components differently, the final
refinement theorem intentionally states membership equivalence of deduplicated physical outputs
rather than list equality. No output-order claim or asymptotic running-time claim is made.
