# Exact capacity decoding with an observed primitive-work bound

The integer-input program returns the physical list described by the agreement specification.
All rates, both field-size regimes, oversized thresholds, and the binary exceptional case are
covered. The gap determines only fixed program parameters and the coefficient. This is a
primitive-work theorem for this same execution, not the unfinished bit-RAM complexity theorem.
