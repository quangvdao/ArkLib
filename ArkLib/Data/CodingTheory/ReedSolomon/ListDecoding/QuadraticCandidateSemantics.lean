# Exactness of base-field candidate acceptance

An extension candidate passes precisely when its physical coefficient vector descends to a
base-field vector satisfying both the degree and agreement conditions. The output retains the
same polynomial under the base embedding. These statements and the work bound concern the
same closed execution; coefficient preparation and enumeration remain separate.
