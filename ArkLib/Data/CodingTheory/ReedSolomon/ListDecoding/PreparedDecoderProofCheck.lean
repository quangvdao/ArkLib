# Exact prepared-driver execution checks

Concrete runs execute coefficient conversion, ordered roots, canonical acceptance and output
collection. The singleton alphabet is a small runtime fixture, not the full-alphabet premise
of the general completeness theorem. Every observed output and charge is kernel checked.
