# Charged constant and empty decoder leaf

Inputs are materialized immutable rows and integer block length and threshold. The leaf first
checks oversizing, then reads at most two rows and compares their received symbols. Equal symbols
produce one descending coefficient cell and one output-list cell in separate instructions.
This leaf uses the flattened primitive-total model of the prepared decoder: natural comparisons,
field equality, dispatch, reads, writes and allocations each have unit charge. It is not a bit-cost
model. No field arithmetic, field enumeration or quadratic setup occurs. Malformed nonoversized
row lists return empty; correctness uses the explicit two-row shape.

read, nil/pointer access, allocation, dispatch and write (5). Empty emission costs 3. -/
