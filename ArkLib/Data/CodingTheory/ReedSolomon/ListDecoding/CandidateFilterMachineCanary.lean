# Executable candidate acceptance boundaries

These kernel computations check the actual dispatcher and aggregate primitive work, not only
the proof-level predicate. Leading nonzero rejection must precede agreement evaluation.

/-- The final output itself requires an instruction. -/
example : runFuel 3 2 2 [(0, 2), (1, 3)] 32 (.start [0, 1, 2] : Configuration ℚ) =

/-- Too few agreements reject after the complete count with the same scheduled work. -/
example : runFuel 3 2 2 [(0, 2), (1, 4)] 33 (.start [0, 1, 2] : Configuration ℚ) =
    (.done none, 272) := by decide +kernel

/-- A nonzero high coefficient cannot be silently discarded, even with threshold zero. -/
example : runFuel 3 2 0 [] 6 (.start [1, 1, 2] : Configuration ℚ) =

/-- Dimension zero still accepts the zero polynomial when the agreement condition holds. -/
