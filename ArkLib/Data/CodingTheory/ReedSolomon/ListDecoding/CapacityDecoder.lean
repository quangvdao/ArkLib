# Executable Reed-Solomon capacity decoding at every rate

The purely mathematical list-existence theorem lives separately in `Capacity.lean`.
This module states the executable decoder's exact-output and primitive-work theorem.
The integer agreement threshold `A` is an instance parameter;
the real gap `delta` is fixed before any block length, rate, field, or received word is chosen.

The output is a list of coefficient vectors. Polynomial membership means degree less than
`k` and at least `A` agreements. In particular, zero is not excluded by a natural-degree convention.
For gaps below one quarter, the prescribed derivative order and multiplicity give exponents `2d`
and `d`, with the explicit prefactor `4m`, in the two field-size regimes.
For larger gaps the bounds are one and strictly less than
the block length `n`. Taking `A = k + ceil(delta*n)` gives radius `1 - k/n - delta`;
the rounding and `Code.Lambda` formulation are established in `Capacity/Radius.lean`.

`capacity_decoder_exact_output_and_primitive_work` executes the integer-input
coordinate decoder and attaches these bounds to its actual coefficient-list output, together
with the observed primitive-work ledger. The runtime materializes its coordinate alphabets and
executes the raw-coordinate recovery, guards and collection. Both field-size inequalities concern
the identical run and list.

**Verification boundary.** The theorem proves a bound on the returned primitive-work ledger.
A same-output refinement to a restricted algebraic machine remains outstanding, including
scalar preparation and control overhead. This is the next algorithmic proof obligation;
a binary backend is not required for that algebraic-machine theorem. No bit-RAM or native
Lean running time is claimed by the primitive ledger below.

/-- A single integer-input decoder outputs exactly the capacity list with both sharp size bounds.
The positive coefficient depends only on the gap. The observed `work` belongs to this same run.

This is a primitive-work theorem, not a bit-complexity theorem. A field operation, scalar check,
fixed-size record operation or charged machine transition has its declared primitive cost;
arbitrary-precision arithmetic, fuel calculation and host administration are not bit-priced here.
The real gap fixes only the integer program constants, and is not an executable input.
Output vectors have exactly `k` coefficients; both vector and polynomial duplicates are excluded.
The use of `Polynomial.degree` includes the zero polynomial in the exact membership statement. -/
