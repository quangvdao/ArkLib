# Agreement thresholds and the capacity-gap radius

This module proves the exact floor-and-ceiling bridge between the integral agreement threshold

`messageDim + Nat.ceil (delta * blockLength)`

and ArkLib's relative Hamming radius

`1 - messageDim / blockLength - delta`.

It then identifies each Reed-Solomon point list with the image, under evaluation, of the set of
agreeing message polynomials. The image formulation does not require injectivity of evaluation and
therefore isolates the cardinality argument from the separate `messageDim ≤ blockLength` condition.
