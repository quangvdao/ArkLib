# Exact output of canonical base-field acceptance

The same terminating program enforces the canonical guard, base-coordinate descent, strict
message degree and the integer agreement threshold. An accepted output represents the original
extension polynomial under the base embedding. The guard's equation-chain interpretation and
whole-list uniqueness are supplied by the root-stage consumer, not assumed by execution.
