# Closed agreement counting with an integer threshold

This fixed machine scans an explicit list of point/value pairs and runs the closed Horner program
on every point. Each Horner transition is an outer transition with the same charge, not an opaque
unit-cost evaluation. The remaining control phases start a call, return its value, compare it with
the received value, update an integer counter, and test the supplied integer threshold `A`.
There are no host callbacks or real-gap computations in the executable machine.

Inputs are a materialized immutable descending coefficient list and a materialized point/value
list. Restarting Horner shares the coefficient-list pointer; it does not copy its cells. Input
conversion, allocation, and preparation are separate obligations. Natural counter addition and
threshold comparison are explicit abstract operations, not bit-cost claims. The model inherits
Horner's abstract field/data-access interpretation and excludes host interpreter bookkeeping.

Outer phase dispatch is charged once per outer instruction; during a Horner call its instruction
dispatch is the machine dispatch. Output counts include each Horner return value plus the two
components of the final count/acceptance result. This file certifies one polynomial's acceptance,
not degree checking, candidate enumeration, or a complete decoder.
