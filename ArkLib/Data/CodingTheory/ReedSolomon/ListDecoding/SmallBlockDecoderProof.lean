# Exact exceptional-block decoding

The initial size is related to the materialized input by using `List.ofFn` on `Fin n` throughout.
Oversized thresholds give an empty result at any block length. For two coordinates, the actual
quarter-gap integer threshold leaves only dimension one and agreement two when feasible.
The charged leaf therefore works over every field, including characteristic two, without setup.
