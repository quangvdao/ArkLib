# Ordered output collection boundaries

Synthetic context-tagged inputs test this collector independently of chain generation. Accepted
base polynomials retain their order while center and prefix failures are removed. Repeating an
identical input record repeats its output: the collector does not secretly implement a set or
claim duplicate freedom without the stage enumerator's uniqueness contract.
