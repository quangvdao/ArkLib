# Exact polynomial acceptance by the executable candidate filter

Materialized descending coefficient vectors may contain leading zeros. The closed filter
accepts exactly the polynomials of degree below the message dimension with the requested
number of agreements. Its accepted output represents the same polynomial in the requested
width. Input preparation, base-field descent and duplicate removal are not part of this filter.
