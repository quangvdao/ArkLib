# Closed degree and agreement filtering of one candidate

The program first checks the high coefficients, then counts agreements using the emitted
short coefficient vector. Each callee advances one instruction at a time. A scalar work count
sums every category in each callee's operation vector and adds wrapper dispatch and root
accesses. Thus this is a unit-cost primitive bound, not a bit-complexity assertion.

Inputs are materialized descending coefficients and point/value pairs. Base-field descent,
candidate enumeration, deduplication, input preparation and scalar bit costs are separate.
