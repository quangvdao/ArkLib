# Exact accepted subsequences and linear collection overhead

The actual collection program returns exactly the accepted subsequence of its materialized
stage records. Each emitted base polynomial satisfies the message degree/agreement conditions
and embeds to its originating candidate. Work is linear in the number of input records times
the proved per-record acceptance budget, not quadratic in candidate count. Completeness and
duplicate freedom for all solutions require the generated stage records' additional contracts.
