# Independent recovery and guard-grid execution checks

These runs recover the zero polynomial using the sample at one, but enumerate its center at
zero. The guard grid at zero accepts; the grid at one and the empty grid reject. Thus the driver
does not silently reuse its recovery grid for canonical-center selection. The singleton alphabet
is a small operational fixture, not a full-field completeness premise.
