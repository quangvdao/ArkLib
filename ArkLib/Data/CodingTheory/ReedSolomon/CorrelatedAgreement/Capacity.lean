# Mutual correlated agreement up to capacity: lines, affine families, and power batching

This file states all three public properties and their capacity theorems explicitly.
For every positive gap `δ`, the length threshold `N`, derivative order `d`, and constant
`C` depend only on that gap, not on the field, rate, evaluation set, or received words.

* **Lines:** at most `C * n ^ (d + 1)` exceptional challenges.
* **Affine families:** exceptional density at most `C * n ^ (d + 1) / (|F| - 1)`,
  independently of the number of directions.
* **Power batching:** at most `ℓ * C * n ^ (d + 1)` exceptional challenges for
  `w₀ + z * w₁ + ... + z ^ ℓ * wℓ`, with no characteristic restriction depending on `ℓ`.

Affine families use independent parameters; power batching uses powers of a single parameter.
An affine exceptional set can contain an entire polynomial curve, so these are distinct results.

## How to read the statements

`∃` means “there exist”, `∀` means “for every”, and `→` introduces an assumption.
The gap-only constants come first. Each exceptional set is chosen before the challenge and
every close polynomial. The constituent witnesses may depend on the challenge and polynomial.

`Fin n ↪ F` specifies distinct evaluation points. The condition `k + δ * n ≤ A` says
that the integer agreement threshold is at least `k + ceil(δ * n)`.
`P.degree < k` includes the zero polynomial. `F[X]` denotes polynomials;
`z • P` scales coefficients. A `let` abbreviates an expression rather than adding a hypothesis.

Every witness conclusion recovers the candidate polynomial and its **full** agreement set,
not merely a large common subset. Line and power-batching results allow infinite fields.
Affine densities and the final probability formulation require finite fields.

These are mathematical agreement theorems, not running-time bounds. In the small-gap regime,
`exists_prescribedLineMCA` and `exists_prescribedCurveMCA` use the manuscript's exact
mixed-bidegree constant `prescribedMCAConstant`. The existential presentations below enlarge
that constant by one only to supply an unconditional positive witness. The half-gap line theorem
states the sharper `2 * n` bound separately, over every field. For gaps between one quarter and
one half, these existential presentations still use small-gap parameters; the manuscript's
special quadratic bound in that interval is not claimed here.

/-- Characteristic-free mutual correlated agreement at the half gap.

Here `n / 2` is natural-number division: the threshold is `k + floor(n/2)`, which also covers
the paper's real half-gap threshold. There is no minimum block length and no
restriction on the field characteristic. One set of at most `2 * n` exceptional challenges works
for every close polynomial, and outside it the complete agreement set is the common agreement set
of two degree-`< k` constituents. Thresholds above `n` are allowed and give an empty exceptional
set because no polynomial can have that many agreements. -/

/-- **Power-batching MCA up to capacity.** Every positive gap admits a block threshold,
derivative order, and positive field-independent constant such that degree-`ℓ` powers batching
has at most `ℓ * C * n^(d+1)` exceptional challenges.  Outside them, every close polynomial is
the exact power combination of low-degree constituent messages and has precisely their common
agreement set. -/
