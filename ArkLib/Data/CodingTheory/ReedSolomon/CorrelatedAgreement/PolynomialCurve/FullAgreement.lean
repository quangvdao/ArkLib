# Exact correlated agreement for power batching

The constituent polynomials live over the received-word field, even when the challenge
is selected in an extension field. Exactness means equality of the entire agreement set,
not merely existence of a common subset of a prescribed size.

/-- A close polynomial is exactly a power combination of base-field messages, and its full
agreement set is exactly their common agreement set.

The tuple has `ℓ + 1` constituents, corresponding to the weights `1,z,…,z^ℓ`. Each constituent
has degree below `k`. The scalar embedding `ι` is explicit so the statement supports both
extension-field geometry and the final base-field theorem. -/
