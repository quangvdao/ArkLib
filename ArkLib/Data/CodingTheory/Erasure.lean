# Erasure-decoding uniqueness

The metric fact underlying erasure decoding: fewer than `minDist C` erasures leave at most one
codeword consistent with the observed word. Equivalently, a code of minimum distance `d`
corrects `d - 1` erasures.

The observations are modelled as an `Option`-valued word, `none` marking an erasure. This
file packages the general exceptional-coordinate theorem
`Code.eq_of_disagreementCols_subset_of_card_lt_minDist` for that shape; the correction
*algorithm* and its cost are out of scope, ArkLib having no cost model to state them in.
