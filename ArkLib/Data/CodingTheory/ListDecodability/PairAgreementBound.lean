# Exact counting bounds from pairwise agreement

This module isolates the elementary Cauchy--Schwarz estimate for a finite family of words. If
every word in a family agrees with a received word in at least `A` positions and distinct words
agree in at most `r` positions, then

`|T| * (A^2 - n * r) <= n * (n - r)`.

Unlike the usual relative-radius Johnson bound, this form retains the exact square and therefore
continues to give useful integral bounds at its boundary cases.

The proof reuses `Code.sq_sum_agree_le` and follows the finite double-counting structure already
used by `Code.card_le_of_pairwise_agree_le`.

/-- The exact Cauchy--Schwarz agreement estimate for a finite family of words.

The hypothesis `pairAgreement ≤ |index|` makes the real-valued right hand side nonnegative and
records the natural range of an agreement bound explicitly. -/
