# The subspace-design upper bound, and the code families that satisfy it

[CZ25]'s theorem that a code carrying a subspace-design profile is list-decodable up to a relaxed
generalized Singleton radius, its real-radius and `η`-parameterized reformulations, and the two
code-family corollaries it exists to serve: folded Reed-Solomon codes and univariate multiplicity
codes achieve list-decoding capacity.

See `ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ListDecodability/Bounds.lean` for the family overview, the
quantification conventions, and the references.

/-- **Subspace-design codes are list-decodable up to capacity** — [CZ25, Theorem B.5], the
one-integer-parameter form at [CZ25]'s `(k−1)`-level design premise. This is the engine behind
[ABF26] Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5, but it is **not** [ABF26] Theorem 3.4 as printed; see the
last paragraph.

[CZ25, Theorem B.5] verbatim, in its own variables: "Given a `F`-linear code `C ⊆ (F^s)^n` of block
length `n` and rate `R = k/sn`. Assume that `C ⊆ (F^s)^n` is a `(ℓ, ℓ(k−1)/(s−ℓ+1))`-strong
subspace designable code for all `ℓ ≤ s`. Then, `C` is `(L/(L+1) · (1 − sR/(s−L+1)), L)`
(average-radius) list-decodable for any `L ≤ s`." The `IsSubspaceDesign` condition is
`(∑ᵢ dim Aᵢ)/n ≤ dim A · τ(r)`, i.e. a budget of `n · dim A · τ(r)`, so [CZ25]'s
`(ℓ, ℓ(k−1)/(s−ℓ+1))` premise is exactly the profile `τ(ℓ) = (sR − 1/n)/(s−ℓ+1)` — the `(k−1)`
level, since `sR − 1/n = (k−1)/n`. For every integer `1 ≤ L ≤ s`,

  `|Λ(C, L/(L+1) · (1 − sR/(s−L+1)))| ≤ L` .

**Two weakenings of this premise are each FALSE, and both were caught by compiled
counterexamples.** The statement is brittle in exactly one direction, so both are recorded.

*Arbitrary `τ`.* An early version quantified over an arbitrary `τ : ℕ → ℝ` while asserting [CZ25]'s
sharp `L/(L+1)` radius. Over `𝔽₂` with `ι = Fin 2`, `s = 1` and `C = span {(1,1)}`, the profile
`τ ≡ 0` *is* a legitimate subspace design — no nonzero codeword vanishes anywhere, so
`A ⊓ ker (proj i) = ⊥` and every design sum is `0` — yet at `L = s = 1` the radius `1/2 · (1 − 0)`
has absolute radius `⌊1/2 · 2⌋ = 1`, and the ball around `(0,1)` holds both codewords, giving
`Λ ≥ 2 > 1`. `τ ≡ 0` is monotone and non-negative, so **neither monotonicity nor non-negativity
rescues the arbitrary-`τ` form**; what fails is decoupling `τ` from the rate.

*The `k` level.* Pinning `τ` to the rate is still not enough. The profile `sR/(s−r+1)` — [ABF26]
Theorem 2.18's printed profile, one notch weaker than [CZ25]'s — also makes this statement
**false**. Over `𝔽₂` with `ι = Fin 3`, `s = 1` and `C = span {(1,1,0)}` (so `k = 1`, `n = 3`,
`R = 1/3`) the `k`-level condition holds *with equality*: the single vanishing coordinate gives
`(∑ᵢ dim Cᵢ)/n = 1/3 = 1 · τ(1)`. But at `L = 1` the radius `1/2 · (1 − 1/3) = 1/3` has absolute
radius `1`, and `(1,0,0)` is at distance `1` from both `(0,0,0)` and `(1,1,0)`, so `Λ ≥ 2 > 1`. An
exhaustive sweep over `𝔽₂` finds 385 such code/`L` pairs at `(s,n) ∈ {(1,3),(1,4),(2,3)}` — so this
is not an `s = 1` artefact — and every one of them fails the `(k−1)` premise, placing the falsity
exactly and only in that notch. Structurally, at `s = 1` the `k` level says only `d ≥ n − k`, while
unique decoding at `(1−ρ)/2` needs `d ≥ n − k + 1` whenever `n − k` is even.

**Why the level is load-bearing rather than a fidelity nicety.** [CZ25]'s Lemma B.4 derives
`∑ᵢ dim(Hᵢ ∩ W) ≥ ℓk/(s−ℓ+1)` and concludes "this contradicts the assumption that `C` is a
`(ℓ, ℓ(k−1)/(s−ℓ+1))`-strong subspace designable code". At the `k` level the derived bound and the
premise coincide, so there is no contradiction to derive and the argument collapses. Nothing
compensates: `R` is the code's own rate and occurs identically in premise and conclusion, so the `k`
level is unambiguously the weaker premise, hence unambiguously the stronger — and false — claim.

`isSubspaceDesign_frsCode_sub_one` supplies this `(k−1)` premise for folded Reed-Solomon codes; its
Wronskian count derives it directly, `isSubspaceDesign_frsCode` being its `1/n`-relaxation.

The rate is carried as a parameter `R` with its defining equation `_hR`, following
`mds_johnson_lambda_le_of_rate_distance`. The equation is an **equality**, not `≤`: a larger `R`
weakens the design premise *and* the conclusion, so the `≤` form is not implied by the source. `R`
is the alphabet-normalized rate `k/(s·n)` of [ABF26] Definition 2.5, the alphabet being `F^s`.

The `if r ∈ Finset.Icc 1 s` guard is the shape `isSubspaceDesign_frsCode_sub_one` produces, and is
necessary: outside `[1, s]` the expression `(sR − 1/n)/(s−r+1)` is negative, which no code
satisfies.

`1 ≤ L` is implicit in [CZ25] (the proof derives a contradiction from `L + 1 ≥ 2` distinct
polynomials; at `L = 0` the claim fails for any word equal to a codeword), and `L ≤ s` is the stated
range.

**What [ABF26] Theorem 3.4 says, and why it is not this.** The paper prints
`Λ(C, 1 − τ(1/η) − η) ≤ (1 − τ(1/η))/η` for a `τ`-subspace-design code at an **arbitrary** `τ` — no
integer parameter, no rate pin, and `τ` applied to the real argument `1/η`. That is an abstraction
of [CZ25] which [CZ25] does not prove, and it is *not* refuted by either counterexample above: at
`τ ≡ 0` it asserts only `Λ(C, 1−η) ≤ 1/η`, which the length-`n` repetition code satisfies for every
`η`. It remains an open generalization. `subspaceDesign_lambda_le_of_eta` is its shape at the pinned
profile. -/

/-- **Real-radius form of the subspace-design bound**, derived in-tree from
`subspaceDesign_lambda_le`. If `t` dominates the rate-derived profile on the integers
`1 ≤ L ≤ 1/η` (and `1/η ≤ s` keeps the chosen integer inside [CZ25]'s range), then

  `|Λ(C, 1 − t − η)| ≤ (1 − t)/η` .

This is the engine behind both the real-argument `η`-form (`subspaceDesign_lambda_le_of_eta`) and
the folded-RS corollary (`frs_lambda_le_capacity`, where `t` is the profile evaluated at `1/η`).
The proof instantiates the integer theorem at `L := ⌊(1 − t)/η⌋` and uses
monotonicity of `Λ` in the radius: `L + 1 > (1 − t)/η` makes the integer radius
`L/(L+1)·(1 − sR/(s−L+1))` at least `1 − t − η`, and `L ≤ (1 − t)/η` is the claimed list bound. This
mirrors [CZ25]'s own derivation of its Corollary 2.21 from its Theorem 1.3.

Note this is generic in the *dominating value* `t`, not in the profile: the profile stays pinned,
for the reason spelled out on `subspaceDesign_lambda_le`. -/

/-- **The `η`-form of the subspace-design bound**, derived in-tree from
`subspaceDesign_lambda_le`. This is the shape of [ABF26] Theorem 3.4 at the pinned profile: for a
code carrying the `(k−1)`-level design profile and any `η > 0` with `1/η ≤ s`,

  `|Λ(C, 1 − sR/(s−1/η+1) − η)| ≤ (1 − sR/(s−1/η+1))/η` .

**No rounding is involved.** [ABF26] prints the profile at the real argument `1/η`, which is
ill-typed for a `τ : ℕ → ℝ` indexed by a dimension. It does not need to be rounded to be reproduced:
`subspaceDesign_lambda_le_of_profile_le` is generic in the *dominating value*, so instantiating it
at `t := sR/(s − 1/η + 1)` — the profile expression at the real argument — gives the paper's display
verbatim, with the domination hypothesis immediate from `L ≤ 1/η ⇒ s − L + 1 ≥ s − 1/η + 1`.
An earlier version instead rounded `1/η` down in both the radius and the bound; the two roundings
pull in opposite directions (the profile is increasing, so a smaller argument enlarges the radius
but also enlarges the bound), so that statement neither implied nor followed from the paper's. It
also needed `η ≤ 1` to keep `⌊1/η⌋ ≥ 1`, which the real-argument form does not.

Non-negativity of `R` is *proved* rather than hypothesised (`LinearCode.alphabetRate` lands in
`ℚ≥0`). `1/η ≤ s` keeps the instantiation point inside [CZ25]'s range `L ≤ s`; it is the hypothesis
the abstract statement omits and its only instantiation carries as `1/η < s`. -/

/-- **Folded Reed-Solomon codes are list-decodable up to capacity** ([ABF26] Corollary 3.5, after
[CZ25, Corollary 2.21]). For `C := FRS[F, L, k, s, ω]` of rate `ρ` and any `η > 0` with `1/η < s`:

  `|Λ(C, 1 - ρ·s/(s - 1/η + 1) - η)| ≤ (s·(1-ρ) + 1 - 1/η) / (η·(s + 1 - 1/η))` .

When `η ≥ √(3/s)` the bound simplifies to `|Λ(C, 1 - ρ - η)| ≤ 1/η`.

**Derived in-tree**, not a separate admit: from `subspaceDesign_lambda_le` (via
`subspaceDesign_lambda_le_of_profile_le` at the real-argument profile value
`t := ρ·s/(s − 1/η + 1)`) together with `isSubspaceDesign_frsCode_sub_one`, whose Wronskian count
delivers exactly the `(k−1)`-level profile this chain needs. The `1/n`-relaxed
`isSubspaceDesign_frsCode` does **not** suffice: at that level `subspaceDesign_lambda_le` is false.
This is the route [CZ25] use for their Corollary 2.21 and [ABF26] for this one. The bound equals
`(1 − t)/η` verbatim, since
`1 − sρ/(s−1/η+1) = (s(1−ρ)+1−1/η)/(s+1−1/η)`.

**Rate convention.** `FRS[F, L, k, s, ω] ⊆ (F^s)^n` has rate `ρ = k / (s·n)`, the alphabet being
`F^s`, **not** `k/n`. With this `ρ` both the radius and the list bound are the source's expressions
verbatim; the radius numerator `ρ·s` is `k/n`.

**Why `_hk_le : k ≤ s·n` is needed.** It is what makes the paper's `ρ = k/(s·n)` equal to
`LinearCode.alphabetRate`, which is `min k (s·n)/(s·n)`. An earlier version avoided this hypothesis
by using only `alphabetRate ≤ ρ` and letting profile domination absorb the gap — but that route
depended on `subspaceDesign_lambda_le` holding at an arbitrary profile, which is **false** (see its
docstring). With the profile pinned to the rate by an equality, the rate must match exactly, so the
below-saturation hypothesis is genuine. It is harmless: the capacity regime has `ρ < 1` anyway.

**Admissibility.** [ABF26] Definition 2.15 bakes `(L, s)`-admissibility of `ω` into the code;
ArkLib's `frsCode` deliberately does not, so it is carried here as `_hadm`. Without it the fold
degenerates — at `ω = 1` all folds collapse — and the capacity bound is false.

**Generator hypothesis.** `_hω_gen : ω` generates `F×` is inherited from
`isSubspaceDesign_frsCode_sub_one`, whose unguarded form is FALSE for low-order `ω` (counterexample
`ω = -1` over `𝔽₁₀₁`; see that declaration's docstring). It is also the classical folded-RS setting
of [CZ25] and Guruswami–Rudra, where the fold element is primitive. `ω ≠ 0` is not a separate
hypothesis, being derivable from it. -/

/-- **Univariate multiplicity codes are list-decodable up to capacity** — the corollary [ABF26]
asserts exists without stating it: "*Since folded Reed-Solomon codes are subspace-design codes the
above theorem implies that they are list decodable up to capacity (**a similar corollary can be
derived for univariate multiplicity codes**)*". For `C := UM[F, L, k, s]` of rate `ρ` and any
`η > 0` with `1/η < s`, the same display as Corollary 3.5:

  `|Λ(C, 1 - ρ·s/(s - 1/η + 1) - η)| ≤ (s·(1-ρ) + 1 - 1/η) / (η·(s + 1 - 1/η))` .

**Derived in-tree, sorry-free and axiom-clean** by the same chain as `frs_lambda_le_capacity`:
`subspaceDesign_lambda_le` via `subspaceDesign_lambda_le_of_profile_le` at
`t := ρ·s/(s − 1/η + 1)`, with the `(k−1)`-level design premise supplied by
`isSubspaceDesign_umCode_sub_one`.

[CZ25] prove the multiplicity case directly too, as their Theorem 1.5 — "*Let `p` be a prime number.
For any integers `s, n, L ≥ 1`, `k ∈ [n]`, and distinct `α₁, …, α_n ∈ F_p`, the code
`MULT^{(s)}_{n,k}(α₁, …, α_n)` over the alphabet `F_p^s` is `(L/(L+1)(1 − sR/(s−L+1)), L)`
list-decodable*" — with Corollary 1.6 / A.10 as the `(1 − R − ε, O(1/ε))` form. Going through the
field-generic Theorem B.5 instead gives this for **any** field satisfying the characteristic
condition, not only prime fields.

**Hypotheses.** `_hchar` is inherited from `isSubspaceDesign_umCode_sub_one`; it is [ABF26] Theorem
2.18's `char(F) > k`, relaxed to `k ≤ ringChar F`, which is all the Wronskian argument needs (`d!`
must be a unit for `d < k`) and which the disjunction with `ringChar F = 0` keeps from forcing
`k = 0` in characteristic zero. `_hk_le : k ≤ s·n` is what makes the paper's `ρ = k/(s·n)` equal
`LinearCode.alphabetRate`; unlike the folded case there is no admissibility or generator
hypothesis, multiplicity codes needing neither. -/
