# The large-alphabet barrier

Attaining the generalized Singleton bound forces an exponentially large alphabet: for a fixed list
size `ℓ ≥ 2` and rate `ρ`, a linear code that is `ℓ`-list-decodable at radius
`ℓ/(ℓ+1)·(1 − ρ − η)` must have `|F| ≥ 2^(α/η)`. That is `large_alphabet_lambda_lower`, after
[BDG24] for `ℓ = 2` and [AGL23] in general, and `large_alphabet_card_ge_exp_of_inv_length` is the
consequence [ABF26] draws from it — at `η = Θ(1/n)`, `|F| ≥ 2^{Ω(n)}`.

The argument runs through `Bounds/LargeAlphabet/`: bound the local neighbourhood of a centre from
`Λ ≤ ℓ`, greedily extract a large *separated* subcode, and contradict a robust minimum-distance
barrier built from sparse large-union families and a pigeonhole count. The source argues
probabilistically at that last step; here it is a counting argument, so no distribution over codes
is needed.

/-- **Attaining the generalized Singleton bound forces a large alphabet** ([ABF26] Theorem 3.10,
after [BDG24] and [AGL23]). For every `ℓ ≥ 2` and `ρ ∈ (0, 1)` there is a constant `α > 0` such
that for every `η > 0` and every sufficiently large `n`, every linear code `C ⊆ F^n` of rate `ρ`
with `|Λ(C, ℓ/(ℓ+1) · (1-ρ-η))| ≤ ℓ` satisfies

  `|F| ≥ 2^{α / η}` ,

so approaching the generalized Singleton bound to within `η` costs alphabet size exponential in
`1/η`. Per [AGL23, Theorem 1.1] the length threshold is `n ≥ Ω_{ℓ,ρ}(1/η)`, which is why `n₀` is
bound *inside* the `∀ η`.

**The rate is pinned by equality, which is faithful but partly vacuous.** [AGL23] states the
barrier for a code "of rate `R`" — Theorem 1.1 as *printed* omits the rate hypothesis altogether,
which is a defect in that paper; the hypothesis appears in its abstract and in the worked
Propositions 3.2/3.3 — and [BDG24] (the `ℓ = 2` progenitor) is stated for `[n, k]`-MDS codes of
fixed dimension. Equality is therefore the faithful reading. The price is that at irrational `ρ` the
statement is vacuous, and at rational `ρ = a/b` it is inhabited only for `b ∣ n`; instantiate at
`ρ = finrank/n`.

A two-sided band `ρ ≤ finrank/n ≤ ρ + 1/n`, as `random_linear_lambda_lower` uses and this file's
own quantification convention prescribes, would remove that vacuity and is supported by [AGL23]'s
*proof*: it rounds `R` down to a multiple of `3/n` and passes to a subcode ("Taking `C′` to be any
subcode of `C` of rate `R′`", Prop. 3.2; "Subcode `C′` has rate at least `R′ = R − (1/n)`",
Prop. 3.3). It is not implied by the printed equality form, though — recovering rate exactly `ρ·n`
from a code of rate in the band needs `ρ·n ∈ ℤ` — so it would be a mild strengthening, and the
choice is left as recorded rather than made.

**The length threshold is the source's, and the quantifier order is load-bearing.** [AGL23] state
`n ≥ Ω_{ℓ,ρ}(1/η)`, i.e. one threshold constant for all `η`; their Theorem 4.3 spells it out as
"there exists `n₀ = n₀(L,R)` such that the following holds for all `n ≥ n₀` **and `ε ≥ 1/n`**". Both
conditions are reproduced below, with `n₀` bound *outside* `∀ η` and `1/η ≤ n` as a hypothesis. A
weaker `∃ n₀` *inside* `∀ η` — letting the threshold depend on `η` arbitrarily — would be the safe
direction, but it would make this theorem's only intended consequence unreachable: instantiating at
`η := c/n` fixes `n` first and then needs `n₀(c/n) ≤ n`, which nothing supplies. That consequence is
`large_alphabet_card_ge_exp_of_inv_length`, and it is the reason this theorem exists in [ABF26] —
the paper never cross-references the theorem itself.

**Two further divergences, both recorded rather than repaired.** (i) [ABF26] states this for an
arbitrary code `C : Σ^k → Σ^n`, and dropping linearity is precisely [AGL23]'s headline advance over
[BDG24]; the theorem below is the linear-over-a-field case, so it does not capture the cited result
in full. (ii) `η` is unguarded, and for `η > 1 − ρ` the radius `ℓ/(ℓ+1)·(1−ρ−η)` is negative, so
`Λ = 0 ≤ ℓ` holds for every code and the statement demands `|F| ≥ 2^(α/η)` unconditionally. Letting
`η ↓ (1−ρ)` therefore forces `α ≤ 1 − ρ`, since `𝔽₂` carries rate-`ρ` codes of every admissible
length. That does not make the statement false — `α := min (α_source) (1−ρ)` still works, shrinking
`α` only weakening the conclusion — but a prover will meet the constraint, and the sources plainly
intend `η` in the meaningful range. -/

/-- **Attaining the generalized Singleton bound exactly forces an exponentially large alphabet** —
the consequence [ABF26] draws from Theorem 3.10, and the only use it puts that theorem to: "*this
shows that achieving exactly the generalized singleton bound (which implies the case when
`η = Θ(1/n)`) requires an alphabet of exponential size, which is undesirable.*"

At `η := c/n` the barrier's `2^{α/η}` becomes `2^{(α/c)·n}`, so for every `ℓ ≥ 2`, `ρ ∈ (0,1)` and
`c ≥ 1` there is `α > 0` with

  `|Λ(C, ℓ/(ℓ+1) · (1 − ρ − c/n))| ≤ ℓ  ⟹  |F| ≥ 2^{α·n}`

for every rate-`ρ` linear code of sufficiently large length `n`.

**Derived in-tree, sorry-free and axiom-clean** from `large_alphabet_lambda_lower`. `1 ≤ c` is
exactly [AGL23]'s `ε ≥ 1/n` at `η = c/n`, and it is the meaningful range: relative radii are
`1/n`-quantised, so `η < 1/n` asks for a radius finer than the lattice the list size lives on. -/
