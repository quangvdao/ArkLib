# A Johnson-type counting bound from pairwise agreement
The counting argument behind the Johnson bound uses nothing about the code beyond a uniform
bound on the agreement of two distinct codewords: if any two distinct codewords of `C ⊆ ι → A`
agree in at most `s² · |ι|` positions, then at most `1 / (2ηs)` codewords lie within relative
distance `1 - s - η` of any word.
This is the alphabet-agnostic core of `ReedSolomon.card_le_of_subset_closeCodewords`, and is what
lets the Reed–Solomon list-decoding bound be transported to interleaved Reed–Solomon codes, whose
alphabet is `Fin s → F`.

/-- **Johnson-type counting bound.** If distinct codewords of `C` agree in at most `s² · |ι|`
positions, then any finite set of codewords within relative distance `1 - s - η` of a word `y`
has at most `1 / (2ηs)` elements. -/
