# Materialized prefix axes from a shared universe

Each supplied length resets a cursor to the shared materialized universe. A counter loop copies
its prefix, then explicit reversal restores element order. A separate allocation stores the axis;
the outer reversal restores length-list order. Exhausting the universe before the counter rejects
the entire construction. Zero lengths succeed with empty axes. Emission is a separate transition.

Costs use the scalar-free Cartesian-product categories. Cell reads return head and tail together;
retained pointers are shared. Constants, input materialization, reclamation and host fuel are
outside this model. No take, map or reverse primitive occurs in dispatch. The intended consumer
constructs anisotropic grid axes from a base-field or quadratic-field enumeration before the
Cartesian-product machine. This component neither evaluates points nor chooses grid lengths.
