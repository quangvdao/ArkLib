# Materialized finite Cartesian products

The machine reverses the axis pointers, then constructs suffix products from right to left.
Each chosen element allocates a tuple prefix sharing its existing suffix. Tuple-prefix and outer
list-cell allocation are separate transitions. Each accumulated product is explicitly reversed.
The resulting order is lexicographic in the original axis and element order; duplicates remain.

Costs count control, register/cell accesses and allocation, natural operations, and final output.
Cell reads return head and tail together; retained pointers and tuple tails are shared. Literal
empty pointers, input materialization, reclamation and host interpreter bookkeeping are outside
the model. No scalar operation or arbitrary callback is used. Bulk list operations appear only
in specifications and proofs. Consumers are anisotropic sampling grids and exponent-coordinate
boxes; neither evaluation of grid points nor filtering of exponent boxes is performed here.
