  # Simple Random-Oracle Commitment Scheme

  A simple non-interactive commitment scheme in the random-oracle model, expressed as an
  *ordinary* commitment scheme (VCV-io's `CommitmentScheme`):

  - The public parameter is the random oracle itself, modeled as a uniformly sampled function
    `ro : α × β → γ`. Over finite query and response spaces a uniformly random function is exactly
    a random oracle.
  - To commit to a message `v : α`, sample randomness `r : β` and output the commitment
    `ro (v, r) : γ` together with the opening `r`.
  - To open the commitment `cm`, the committer reveals `(v, r)`; verification recomputes
    `ro (v, r)` and checks that it equals `cm`.

  Because opening reveals the whole message `v` (rather than an oracle evaluation of hidden data),
  this is an *ordinary* commitment, so it instantiates VCV-io's oracle-free
  `CommitmentScheme PP M C D` directly. It mirrors VCV-io's standard-model hash commitment
  `CollisionResistance.KeyedHashFamily.toCommitment`, with a random oracle in place of a keyed
  hash family. For commitments with oracle openings, see `ArkLib.Commitments.Functional.Basic`.

  DISCLAIMER: this works but is a bit weird — it's an oracle commitment scheme without an oracle.
  VCV-io's `CommitmentScheme` only supports `ProbComp` (`OracleComp unifSpec`), not a general
  `OracleComp`, so the random oracle is baked in as a sampled function `ro : α × β → γ`. Two
  cleaner fixes: (1) model it as a functional commitment whose function just opens the whole
  commitment (weird, since it's then not really functional), or (2) extend VCV-io's
  `CommitmentScheme` to support a general `OracleComp`, not just `ProbComp`.
