  # Batching bridge — Hachi Eqs. (22)–(23)

  A zero-round reduction between two readings of the lift's claims:

  * `relLift` — `w̃` opens `t`, the per-row `α`-evaluated constraints hold, `w̃` is short
    (`RingSwitch/Reduction.lean`, the committed-scalar shell at `liftCheckAt`);
  * `relBatched` — `w̃` opens `t`, the batched polynomials `H₀^{w̃}` and `H_α^{w̃}` are identically
    zero (Eqs. (22)–(23), `ZeroCheck/Constraints.lean`).

  The statement and witness are unchanged (`ReduceClaim` at `mapStmt := id`); only the reading of
  the claims changes, which separates the batching algebra from the transcript-tree zero test.
  Shortness is **not** a conjunct of `relBatched`: the range identity `H₀^{w̃} ≡ 0`
  already forces every committed coefficient into `[−(b−1), b−1]`, so `liftShort` is *derived*, not
  assumed — the range machinery is load-bearing.

  The reduction's content is the pull-back `mem_relLift_of_relBatched` from `relBatched` to
  `relLift`: the per-row equation is recovered from `H_α ≡ 0` via `hAlpha_eq_zero_iff`
  and `hAlphaEvals_rowPoint`, and shortness from `H₀ ≡ 0` via `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`. Its
  hypotheses are the arity bounds `n ≤ 2 ^ m₁` and `(μ + n·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2 ^ m₀`, positivity
  `0 < deg φ`, the range-base fit `b − 1 ≤ bound`, and the digit-base admissibility
  `DigitBaseOk q bound bDig`.

  The **honest direction** `mem_relBatched_of_relLift` is proved here too, so the bridge is settled
  both ways: a lift-valid short witness satisfies the two identities. Its halves are
  `hZero_eq_zero_of_liftShort` (shortness puts every table entry among `P_b`'s roots — the converse
  of the range-side soundness) and `hAlpha_eq_zero_of_rows` (the `n` row equations are the *whole*
  Boolean table, which is zero-padded beyond row `n`). It needs neither arity hypothesis and no
  property of `α`, but it needs the range-base fit in the *other* orientation
  (`bound ≤ b − 1`) together with `DigitBaseOk q (b − 1) b`: at the paper's `bound = b − 1`
  both orientations hold and the two relations coincide.
  The link's perfect completeness, which uses this direction **alone** (through
  `ReduceClaim.reduction_completeness_of_imp`, so neither arity hypothesis of the pull-back is
  needed), is `batchReduction_perfectCompleteness` (`ZeroCheck/Completeness.lean`).

  Weak binding enters the certificate as an *event on the transcript tree*, rather than as a
  `⊕ E` relation summand; its hardness target is the
  short-collision set `LiftCom.Collision`. This bridge has no challenge round, so it carries no
  escape at all and composes with escape-aware neighbours through `CWSSPackage.toEscape`.

/-- The batched relation (Hachi Eqs. (22)–(23) as polynomial identities): `w̃` opens `t`, the
range polynomial `H₀^{w̃}` and the linear-constraint polynomial `H_α^{w̃}` are both identically
zero, and `bound ≤ rlin.bound`. This is the zero-check's input relation.

Shortness is **not** a conjunct here: `H₀ ≡ 0` already forces `w̃` short (every committed
coefficient is a root of the range factor `P_b`), so `liftShort` is *derived* — not assumed — by
the pull-back `mem_relLift_of_relBatched` (via `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`). This is the
range machinery being load-bearing rather than inert.

Both conjuncts are the paper's polynomials, not stand-ins. `hAlpha`'s Boolean table is *written*
as the per-row `α`-defect in the ring representation, but `hAlpha_eq_zero_iff_alphaDefect` proves
`hAlpha … = 0` equivalent to the vanishing of every row's Eq. (22) contraction
`∑_{u,ℓ} M̃_α(i,u)·w̃(u,ℓ)·α̃(ℓ) − yᵢ(α)` of the public `M̃_α`/`α̃` against the committed table
(arity pins `hd`, `(μ + n·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2^{m₀}`). So this relation may be read as Eqs. (22)–(23)
themselves rather than as an abstract direct-defect variant of them. -/

/-- The batched identities imply the lift's per-row **and shortness** claims.

The per-row equation is recovered from `H_α ≡ 0`: by `hAlpha_eq_zero_iff` every
Boolean-point coefficient `hAlphaEvals` vanishes, and by `hAlphaEvals_rowPoint` the coefficient at
`rowPoint i` is row `i`'s `α`-evaluated lift defect, giving the row equation of `relLift`.
Shortness (`liftShort`, `relLift`'s norm conjunct) is **derived** from the range identity
`H₀ ≡ 0` via `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`: every committed coefficient is a root of the range
factor `P_b`, hence a centered residue of absolute value `≤ b − 1`, which meets the norm bound
under `hbound : b − 1 ≤ bound`. The quotient half of `liftShort` costs nothing: at an admissible
digit base the committed digits are `⌊bDig/2⌋`-bounded outright (`rhoDigitsShort_of_digitBaseOk`),
which is exactly what the gadget decomposition buys. The `K.com` and bound conjuncts are
shared between the two relations. The hypotheses are the row-encoding bound `hn : n ≤ 2 ^ m₁`, the
column-encoding bound `hμn : (μ + n·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2 ^ m₀`, and `hd : 0 < deg φ`. No anti-wraparound
condition on `q` is needed — see `valMinAbs_natAbs_le_of_rangeProduct_eq_zero`. -/

/-- **Range side of the honest direction**: a short witness makes the range polynomial vanish
identically. Every entry of `w̃` is either a `z`-coefficient — bounded by `bound`, hence by
`b − 1`, hence a root of `P_b` — or a quotient **digit**, which is `⌊b/2⌋`-bounded for *any*
quotient (`rhoDigits_valMinAbs_natAbs_le`) and so is a root of `P_b` with no hypothesis on `w` at
all — or the zero padding, at which `P_b(0) = 0`.

The `z`-side hypothesis is the mirror image of `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`'s: there the declared
bound had to *dominate* the range base (`b − 1 ≤ bound`), here it must be *dominated* by it
(`bound ≤ b − 1`); at `bound = b − 1` both hold and `relLift` and `relBatched` are equivalent rather
than merely comparable. The quotient side needs only that the range base is itself an admissible
digit base, `DigitBaseOk q (b − 1) b`.

Note also what is *not* needed: no arity hypothesis. `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort` needs
`(μ + n·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2 ^ m₀` to know every coefficient position is a genuine cube point; the honest
direction quantifies over cube points instead, and the table is zero-padded, so any surplus cube
points take care of themselves. -/

`H_α`'s Boolean table is zero-padded beyond row `n` (`hAlphaEvals`), so `H_α ≡ 0` needs exactly the

hypothesis, and no property of `α`: the identity holds at *every* evaluation point, which is why
this link's completeness error is `0`. The three `evalAt`/`cEvalAt` bridges are the same ones

lift-valid, short witness satisfies the two batched polynomial identities.

Together with the pull-back this makes `relBatched` *equivalent* to `relLift` at the paper's
parameters (`bound = b − 1`), so the bridge loses nothing in either direction: the range
identity `H₀ ≡ 0` is exactly the shortness of the committed data (`hZero_eq_zero_of_liftShort` /
`hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`), and the constraint identity `H_α ≡ 0` is exactly the `n` row
equations (`hAlpha_eq_zero_of_rows` / `hAlphaEvals_rowPoint`). The `K.com` and bound conjuncts are
shared verbatim, the latter being the `sideCond` of `liftCheckAt`.
