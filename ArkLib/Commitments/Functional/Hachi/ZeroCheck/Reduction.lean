  # Zero-check — Hachi Figure 5 / Lemma 10

  A sequence of scalar challenge rounds reducing the batched polynomial identities
  `H₀ ≡ 0 ∧ H_α ≡ 0` (`relBatched`, `ZeroCheck/Batch.lean`) to evaluations at direct points; the
  two evaluation claims then seed the sumcheck (`Sumcheck/Bridge.lean`). Stated over the lifted
  witness `LiftedWitness Φ μ n` and the weak-binding `LiftCom`.

  ## Deviation from the paper's Lemma 10

  What fails in [NOZ26] is not Figure 5 but its proof: the attempt to certify the polynomial
  identity `H₀ ≡ 0` *deterministically*, from a coordinate-wise star of accepting transcripts. Two
  things go wrong at once (full analysis in `docs/kb/audits/noz26-zero-check-lemma10.md`):

  * *Shape.* `SS(S, ℓ, k)` is star-shaped by definition, so a coordinate-wise family only certifies
    that a multilinear `H` vanishes on the axis cross through the family's center — which for two
    or more variables does not imply `H ≡ 0`
    (`MvPolynomial.exists_nonzero_vanishing_on_axis_cross`), and putting more points on the
    same arms does not help. Under the lemma's own `ℓ = 2` reading the arms carry arbitrary distinct
    challenge *vectors* rather than collinear points, so the axis cross does not apply directly;
    there the objection is a dimension count — `D` points cannot pin down the `2 ^ m₀`-dimensional
    space of multilinears — which is *not* formalized here.
  * *Degree.* Lemma 10's `D = max (2 * d) (2 * b - 1)` is a degree in `α` (Lemma 9) and in the
    witness value `w̃(u, ℓ)` respectively; neither is a degree in a coordinate of `τ`. In `τ` both
    batching polynomials are multilinear, so two distinct labels per coordinate suffice. The
    printed lemma thus over-asks in `D` and under-asks in tree shape.

  Since `w̃` is committed before `τ` is drawn, the *protocol* is fine: Schwartz–Zippel gives
  knowledge error `≈ (m₀ + m₁) / |F|` for Figure 5 exactly as printed. That argument is
  probabilistic, so it does not fit the coordinate-wise special-soundness framework this chain
  composes in ([FMN24], `CWSSPackage`), which is why the scalar-round route below is stated
  instead.

  ## What the scalar rounds change, and what they do not

  This formalization draws the coordinates of `τ₀` and `τα` as `m₀ + m₁` consecutive scalar
  rounds. Since **no prover message separates them** (`pSpecNestedScalar` has no `P_to_V` round),
  the *interactive* protocol is unchanged: the verifier map, the prover, and the uniform
  distribution on `F^{m₀ + m₁}` are the same as Figure 5's. What changes is the shape of transcript
  tree the extractor is handed — a path-dependent complete binary tree instead of a star — plus,
  under Fiat–Shamir, the requirement that the challenge coordinates be hashed *sequentially* rather
  than drawn from one atomic hash call.

  Path dependence is more than is needed here (a product grid of challenge vectors in the single
  original round would do, and is obtainable by rewinding a one-round prover). Round splitting is
  what lets `SS(S, ℓ, k)` and [FMN24] Lemma 4 be reused verbatim; expressing a product-shaped
  family instead would need a new soundness notion and new composition theorems.

  ## Coordinate-wise special soundness

  `nestedZeroCheck_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape` reads the complete binary transcript tree
  and lands in one of two cases:

  1. Two leaves carry **distinct** openings of the shared commitment `t`. Both are short (the
     `liftShort` conjunct of `relNestedZeroCheck`), so the pair is a member of `LiftCom.Collision`
     and the escape event `nestedZeroCheckEsc` fires — a Module-SIS break of the fixed key by
     [NOZ26] Lemma 7 / Remark 2. Weak binding is **not** a field of `LiftCom` and not an extractor
     output: it is an event on `(statement, tree)`, which is what keeps it from being trivially
     satisfiable (a compressing commitment's collision set is never empty).
  2. All leaves carry one opening `w̃`: `H₀` is read through the first `m₀` levels of the *one*
     evaluation tree and `H_α` through its last `m₁` levels
     (`NestedEvaluationTree.eq_zero_of_vanishes_comp`), yielding both polynomial identities, hence
     `relBatched` membership.

  The extractor is executable: `ChallengeTree.LeafWitnesses` supplies an `Option` candidate output
  witness at every leaf, and `nestedZeroCheckExtractor` returns the all-left entry without
  searching the output relation; the certificate proves that lookup correct for *every* valid leaf
  witnessing. Classical choice is confined to the proof, where it assembles a total response family
  from validity witnesses in order to invoke the evaluation-tree argument. Tree size:
  `nestedZeroCheck_numLeaves`/`_lt`.

  ## Where the norm sits

  `relNestedZeroCheck` carries `liftShort` because that predicate is the commitment's *shortness
  index*: `LiftCom.Collision` is defined on pairs of distinct **short** openings, which is what an
  Ajtai-style scheme's binding actually gives — a collision of two long openings is no Module-SIS
  solution. So the conjunct is what makes the escape event sound, not a range assumption smuggled
  in ahead of its proof.

  The range claim proper — the `‖z‖∞ ≤ bound` half of `liftShort` — is still **derived**, at the
  batching bridge, from `H₀ ≡ 0` (`hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`), and `relBatched` remains
  norm-free. (Its quotient half needs no derivation: the committed block holds base-`b` digits,
  which are `⌊b/2⌋`-bounded by construction.) That separation is what this seam has to preserve,
  because this seam genuinely cannot recover the range identity: a single evaluation
  `H₀(τ₀) = 0` never implies `H₀ ≡ 0`.

/-! ### Size of the transcript tree

`CWSSStructure` carries no size bound, so `coordinateWiseSpecialSound` alone cannot tell a usable
construction from one whose family is exponential in the witness length. The two facts below
record the
size, with two caveats on what they establish:

* `nestedZeroCheck_numLeaves` counts the leaves of the *adapter's* `NestedEvaluationTree`. The
  quantity the extractor consumes is the number of `ChallengeTree.LeafPath`s of the structured
  transcript tree; that the two agree is evident from the adapter but is not formalized.
* `nestedZeroCheck_numLeaves_lt` is arithmetic on naturals: minimality of `m₀`, `m₁` enters as its
  hypotheses rather than being enforced, since `hμn` and `hn` bound the arities from below only.

Concretely, at [NOZ26]'s `ℓ = 30` parameters (Fig. 9) the `H₀` table has `(μ + n·δ) * deg φ`
entries, `δ = clog_b q`. The digit widening touches only the quotient block: at `q ≈ 2 ^ 32` and
`deg φ = 2 ^ 10` it grows from `n·d ≈ 2 ^ 12.3` to `n·δ·d ≤ 2 ^ 17.3` (`δ ≤ 32`, maximal at
`b = 2`), adding `≲ 0.25%` to the `≈ 2 ^ 26` that `μ·d` contributes — so the table is still
`≈ 2 ^ 26` and `m₀ = 26`, and `rlinRows = 5` rows gives `m₁ = 3`: about `2 ^ 29` transcripts,
against the `2 * D - 1 = 4095` of the printed Lemma 10's `SS(F, 2, D)` family at
`D = max (2 * d) (2 * b - 1) = 2048`. Polynomial in the witness dimensions, but roughly `2 ^ 17`
times the paper's family, and CWSS leaf counts multiply across rounds.

Only `2 ^ m₀ + 2 ^ m₁ - 1` leaves are *used* (`H₀` needs one accepting continuation per
`τ₀`-prefix, `H_α` one complete `m₁`-subtree), while `ChallengeTree.IsStructured` demands the
complete tree. Converting coordinate-wise special soundness into a knowledge error would need
`K = poly(λ)` in an [FMN24] Lemma-4-style bridge, which this repository does not formalize. -/

/-- The evaluation tree the adapter produces has exactly `2 ^ (m₀ + m₁)` leaves: `m₀ + m₁` challenge
rounds, two pairwise-distinct children each. -/

count, cf. `hn`) — the leaf count is below `4 * A * B`, hence polynomial in the witness dimensions.
Both hypotheses are assumptions on the instantiation; see the caveats above. -/

/-! ## The weak-binding escape event -/

/-- **The zero-check's escape event** (the weak-binding case of the corrected Lemma 10): the tree
admits per-leaf `relNestedZeroCheck`-responses among which two are **distinct short openings** of
the statement's commitment `t` — a member of `LiftCom.Collision`, hence a Module-SIS break of the
fixed key by [NOZ26] Lemma 7.

Against the `ChallengeTree.EscapeEvent` contract: the collision conjunct is an unconditional break
at *every* `(statement, tree)`; it mentions neither the extractor, nor acceptance, nor the
sampling; and the responses are pinned to the **output** relation, which is what keeps the event
tight — it cannot fire on trees where all leaves share one opening, which is exactly where
extraction succeeds. Both openings automatically open `t`: `relNestedZeroCheck`'s first conjunct
pins `K.com w = t` and every leaf's output statement carries the same `t`. -/

Either two leaves carry distinct openings — and then, both being short openings of the shared
commitment `t`, they are a member of `K.Collision` and the escape event fires — or every leaf
carries one opening `w̃`, and the single evaluation tree of depth `m₀ + m₁` reads `H₀` through its
first `m₀` levels (`Fin.castAdd`) and `H_α` through its last `m₁` (`Fin.natAdd`), so both
computable batching polynomials vanish identically and `w̃ ∈ relBatched`.

Every conjunct the collision side needs is supplied by `relNestedZeroCheck` itself: commitment
agreement and `liftShort` for each leaf. -/
