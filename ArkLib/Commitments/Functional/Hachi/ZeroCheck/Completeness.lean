  # Zero-check — completeness (Hachi Figure 5)

  The honest side of the zero-check link. Where `ZeroCheck/Reduction.lean` certifies that *any*
  prover the verifier accepts yields a witness (coordinate-wise special soundness, the corrected
  Lemma 10), this file works towards the converse: that the honest prover is always accepted.

  ## What is proved here

  `nestedZeroCheckReduction_perfectCompleteness`: the honest run of Figure 5 succeeds with
  probability one, the prover's and the verifier's output statements agree, and the resulting
  statement/witness pair lies in `relNestedZeroCheck`. That is `Reduction.perfectCompleteness`
  (`OracleReduction/Security/Basic.lean`) in full, for arbitrary shared oracles `oSpec`, state
  initialization `init` and query implementation `impl`.

  It rests on two independent halves.

  * *Algebra.* `mem_relNestedZeroCheck_of_relBatched`, the relation-preservation step: an honest
    witness for `relBatched` satisfies `relNestedZeroCheck` at the statement reshaped by *any*
    pair of evaluation points. This is where the mathematics lives.
  * *Execution.* `nestedZeroCheckReduction_run_support`: an honest run cannot fail, and whatever
    challenges it draws, prover and verifier come out holding the *same* statement, with the input
    witness passed through untouched. They agree because each reads the transcript the same way —
    the prover's `Fin.castAdd`/`Fin.natAdd` split of its accumulated challenges is literally the
    one `nestedZeroCheckVerifier` applies. Proved by induction over the rounds
    (`nestedZeroCheckProver_state_eq_of_mem_support`), read off at the last round
    (`nestedZeroCheckProver_output_of_mem_support`).

  The two halves are joined by `Reduction.perfectCompleteness_of_run_support`, a general-purpose
  criterion added to `Security/Basic.lean` for this proof: to get perfect completeness it is enough
  to show that *every* possible outcome of the run succeeds and satisfies the completeness event.
  That trades the probabilistic statement for a support statement once and for all, and it holds
  for any reduction of any length over any `oSpec` — so every later link in the chain can reuse it
  rather than unfolding the execution monads by hand.

  The preceding link is closed here too. `batchReduction` / `batchReduction_perfectCompleteness`
  (bottom of this file) is the batching bridge as a protocol object and its perfect completeness,
  so the honest side reaches `relBatched` from `relLift` and the two links meet. Their composition
  lives in `HonestChain.lean`, using the proved pure-verifier append theorem and completeness of
  each suffix from every shared oracle state.

  ## Why the two directions are so unequal in difficulty

  `relBatched` asserts the *polynomial identities* `H₀ ≡ 0` and `H_α ≡ 0`, so both polynomials
  vanish at **every** point — in particular at whatever `τ₀`, `τα` the verifier's challenges
  assemble. The honest direction therefore needs no probabilistic argument and no facts about the
  challenge distribution: `mem_relNestedZeroCheck_of_relBatched` below is stated for arbitrary
  evaluation points, which is why the completeness error for this link is exactly zero. The
  `SampleableType F` hypothesis of the completeness theorem is needed only so that execution can
  draw the challenges at all, never for a property of their distribution.

  The soundness direction is the hard one for the mirror-image reason: a single evaluation
  `H₀(τ₀) = 0` does not imply `H₀ ≡ 0`
  (`MvPolynomial.exists_nonzero_vanishing_on_axis_cross`), which is what forces the per-coordinate
  scalar rounds documented in `ZeroCheck/Reduction.lean`. The asymmetry is structural.

  ## Shortness

  `relNestedZeroCheck` carries the commitment's shortness index `liftShort`, which `relBatched`
  does *not* assume. It is derived here exactly as on the soundness side
  (`mem_relLift_of_relBatched`): from the range identity `H₀ ≡ 0` via
  `hZero_eq_zero_imp_liftShort`, which is what the arithmetic hypotheses `hd`, `hμn`, `hbound`,
  the digit-base admissibility pay for.

on the output statement. Those are supplied by `nestedZeroCheckReduction_run_support`, and the two
are combined in `nestedZeroCheckReduction_perfectCompleteness`.

/-! ## Honest execution

The zero-check has no prover-message rounds, so an honest run only accumulates challenges. The
invariant below is what makes the prover's and verifier's output statements agree: the challenge
prefix the prover carries in its state *is* the transcript, because `Transcript.concat` and the
prover's `Fin.snoc` are the same operation. -/

/-- **Honest-run invariant.** After `i` challenge rounds, the honest prover's state is the input
statement/witness pair together with the transcript so far — the accumulated challenges *are* the
transcript, since `Transcript.concat` is by definition the `Fin.snoc` the prover uses.

This is the bookkeeping half of the `perfectCompleteness` proof: it is what forces the prover's
output statement to coincide with the verifier's, both being `nestedZcMapStmt` applied to the same
`Fin.castAdd`/`Fin.natAdd` split of the same transcript. -/

/-! ## The batching bridge: the honest direction, closed

`Batch.lean` has both relation directions (`mem_relLift_of_relBatched` and
`mem_relBatched_of_relLift`), and a zero-round `ReduceClaim` link needs only the honest one:
`ReduceClaim.reduction_completeness_of_imp` consumes the forward implication
`mem_relBatched_of_relLift` alone. Taking only that direction is what keeps the range hypotheses
in a single orientation — see `batchReduction_perfectCompleteness` below, and `HonestChain.lean`
for what the two-sided reading would cost.
-/

/-- **The batching bridge as a protocol object**: the zero-round `ReduceClaim` reduction at
`mapStmt := id` and the identity witness map — the honest prover of a bridge that only changes how
the claims are *read* does nothing at all. Its verifier is `batchPackage`'s
(`batchReduction_verifier`), so the two security directions of the link cannot drift apart. -/

An honest prover holding a lift-valid short witness is accepted with probability one and the very
same statement/witness pair satisfies the batched identities, the prover's and the verifier's output
statements being equal for the trivial reason that both are the input statement.

**Only the honest direction is used**, via `ReduceClaim.reduction_completeness_of_imp`: the content
is `mem_relBatched_of_relLift` alone, so the range hypotheses appear in one orientation only
(`bound ≤ b − 1` — the declared norm bound is dominated by the range base), and
the pull-back's arity conditions `n ≤ 2 ^ m₁` and `(μ + n·δ)·deg φ ≤ 2 ^ m₀` are not needed at all.

That matters for the chain: a *single* parameterization serving both directions is pinned to
`bound = b − 1` (the pull-back needs the reverse orientation); honest completeness alone
leaves `bound` free below `b − 1`. See `HonestChain.lean`. -/
