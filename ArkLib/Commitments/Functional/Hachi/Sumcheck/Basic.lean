# Hachi Sumcheck Loop

Umbrella module for `Hachi/Sumcheck/`: the sumcheck loop that finishes Hachi's opening
(§4.3 of [NOZ26]). It reduces the zero-check's point-evaluation claims
`H₀(τ₀) = 0 ∧ H_α(τ_α) = 0` to hypercube-sum claims, runs `m₀` sumcheck rounds down to a
single evaluation of the committed table `w̃`, and closes with the final-evaluation step that
hands the resulting short-opening evaluation claim to `EndPiece/`'s `endPiece`. It operates on
the batched-constraint encoding of `ZeroCheck/Constraints.lean` (the sumcheck polynomials
`F_{0,τ₀}`/`F_{α,τ₁}` and `nestedRoundRel`).

## Relation to `ArkLib/ProofSystem/Sumcheck`

This folder is a self-contained round layer, deliberately not built on either generic
sumcheck in `ProofSystem/Sumcheck/`:

* the structured (witness-mode) round rejects by returning a dummy statement
  (`Structured/SingleRound.lean`'s `roundOracleVerifier`), a convention the extraction
  argument here cannot use — all `k` siblings of a tree node share the message pair, so a
  dummy output collapses every branch onto the same statement and destroys extractability.
  Hence the `failure`-guarded `roundVerifier` (see `Sumcheck/Rounds.lean`);
* the wire object differs (`CPolynomial.degreeLE` here, the Mathlib subtype `L⦃≤ d⦄[X]`
  there), as does the shape: Hachi sends the *pair* `(gᵢ⁽⁰⁾, gᵢ⁽ᵅ⁾)` under one shared
  challenge, and its verifier is a plain `Verifier` (the round polynomials go in the clear),
  not an `OracleVerifier`;
* neither generic mode carries a soundness proof to inherit.

## Folder structure

* `Sumcheck/Bridge.lean` — the zero-round entry bridge: from the zero-check's
  point-evaluation claims to the initial sumcheck hypercube-sum claims (`∑ F_{0,τ₀} = 0`,
  `∑ F_{α,τ_α} = a` with the linear target `a` computed by the verifier). Pure reshaping
  through the batching identities.
* `Sumcheck/RoundPoly.lean` — the round-polynomial layer the round soundness runs on: the
  cube split `hypercubeSum_succ`, the partial sum as a univariate `roundPoly` with its
  evaluation and degree lemmas, and the two degree instances at Hachi's summands (`≤ 2b` and
  `≤ 2`). Proof-side only: `roundPoly` is `noncomputable`, the wire object stays computable.
* `Sumcheck/Rounds.lean` — the `m₀`-round paired sumcheck loop: each round sends the
  univariate pair `(gᵢ⁽⁰⁾, gᵢ⁽ᵅ⁾)` under a shared challenge `aᵢ`, checked by guarded round
  verifiers (`gᵢ(0)+gᵢ(1) = targetᵢ₋₁`) and composed by recursion over the binary guarded
  append. Soundness is `round_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWithEscape`, with the computable
  `roundExtractor` reading a supplied branch opening directly and the two load-bearing side
  conditions `i < m₀` and `0 < b`.
* `Sumcheck/FinalEval.lean` — the closing step: the prover sends the claimed evaluation
  `y′ = w̃(a)`, the guarded verifier checks the two final sumcheck targets, and the output is
  the evaluation claim `mle[w̃](a) = y′`. Soundness is
  `finalEval_coordinateWiseSpecialSoundWith`, with its computable `finalEvalExtractor` reading
  the unique leaf opening directly; the honest half (`honestComputeY`,
  `finalEvalReduction_perfectCompleteness`) lives there too. Its verifier can reject, so
  "the honest run cannot fail" is proved from the guard lemma
  rather than holding by construction.
* `Sumcheck/Completeness.lean` — the honest side of the loop: the computable round message
  `honestComputeG` (the summand evaluated in `CPolynomial F` itself, with `X` in the free
  coordinate and constants elsewhere, summed over the remaining cube), one round's perfect
  completeness, the `m₀`-fold honest chain `roundsReduction`, and `sumcheckReduction` = bridge
  ▷ rounds ▷ final evaluation. The per-round and composed statements are axiom-clean, using
  guarded composition and suffix completeness from every shared oracle state.

This umbrella re-exports the folder (`Completeness` transitively imports `FinalEval`,
`Rounds`, `RoundPoly` and `Bridge`). The output relation `relWEvalClaim` is the seam after an
iteration; the full chain is composed in `Composition.lean`.

Extraction here is tree-based: it yields a witness (or an escape) from a structured accepting
tree, and says nothing about a *probability* of extraction. Converting that into a
knowledge-soundness error — the per-round Schwartz–Zippel `2b/|F|` against the `(2b+1)^{m₀}`
leaf count the composed structure demands — needs an [FMN24]-style bridge, which this repository
does not have for any protocol.
