# A computable honest lifted witness

`honestLiftWitness` (`RingSwitch/Completeness.lean`) is the one *essentially* noncomputable step
on Hachi's honest-prover path: the quotient rows are produced by Mathlib's `/ₘ`
(`Presentation.quotient`), then repackaged into the `CPolynomial (ZMod q)` rows `LiftedWitness`
stores through the noncomputable `Polynomial.toImpl`. Since the lifted witness is carried by
every later link and revealed by the terminal message, nothing downstream can be run until this
is fixed.

The fix changes no definition and no statement: the division is synthetic division by a monic
divisor, which CompPoly implements as `CPolynomial.divByMonic` with
`divByMonic_toPoly_eq_divByMonic` as its correctness statement, operating on the canonical
coefficient arrays directly — no Mathlib polynomial is ever built.

So `honestLiftWitnessC` is a computable `def` at the *same signature and same type* as generic
`Lift.honestWitness` at `cyclotomicPresentation` — which is exactly what Hachi's
`honestLiftWitness` (`RingSwitch/Completeness.lean`) is defined to be — and
`honestLiftWitnessC_eq_honestWitness` says they are equal. The noncomputable original stays as
the spec-side definition, every theorem about it applies verbatim, and `liftReduction` is
re-pointed at the computable twin one file up, transferring completeness through the agreement
lemma. This file sits *below* `Completeness.lean` in the import graph so that it can.

## Main definitions

* `cQuotient` / `cQuotient_toPoly` — the computable honest quotient and its agreement with
  `Presentation.quotient` at `cyclotomicPresentation`.
* `honestLiftWitnessC` / `honestLiftWitnessC_eq_honestWitness` — the computable honest lifted
  witness and its agreement with generic `Lift.honestWitness`.
