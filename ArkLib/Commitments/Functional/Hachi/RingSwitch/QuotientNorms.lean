# Centered coefficient bounds for the honest lift quotient

The honest prover of the HMZ25 lift (Hachi Figure 4) commits to the lifted witness `(z, ρ)`, where
`ρᵢ = (rowSumᵢ − rep yᵢ) /ₘ φ` (`Presentation.quotient`). The commitment's shortness regime
`RhoShort ρBound ρ` is a centered coefficient bound on those quotients, and this file proves it
without developing any general theory of coefficient growth under polynomial division.

`liftShort` does not ask for it: the committed quotient block is the base-`b` digit decomposition
(`rhoDigits`), whose coefficients are `⌊b/2⌋`-bounded outright. What the results below establish is
how large an *undecomposed* quotient can get — and `rhoShort_half`'s sharp `q/2` is exactly why the
decomposition is needed.

**The mechanism.** For the power-of-two cyclotomic modulus `φ = X ^ d + 1`, dividing a polynomial of
degree `< 2d` by `φ` *selects* coefficients rather than combining them:
`(p /ₘ φ).coeff k = p.coeff (d + k)` (`Polynomial.coeff_divByMonic_X_pow_add_one`). The dividend
`rowSumᵢ − rep yᵢ` has degree `≤ 2d − 2`, so the quotient's coefficients are literally coefficients
of the row sum, and the bound reduces to a coefficient bound on `∑ⱼ rep(Mᵢⱼ)·rep(zⱼ)`.

**No wraparound condition is needed anywhere.** All bounds go through `valMinAbs_natAbs_le`: the
centered representative is minimal among integer representatives, so exhibiting *any* integer
representative bounds it. `valMinAbs_natAbs_mul_le` and `valMinAbs_natAbs_sum_le_card_mul`
(`NormBounds/Basic`) package that. Consequently no hypothesis of the form `… ≤ q/2` appears below.

## Main results

* `valMinAbs_natAbs_coeff_rep_le`: an `ℓ∞` bound on a ring element bounds every coefficient of its
  presentation representative (including the ones past `deg φ`, which vanish).
* `valMinAbs_natAbs_coeff_rowSum_le`: coefficient bound for the structured row sum,
  `μ · (m+1) · βM · βz` at index `m`.
* `valMinAbs_natAbs_coeff_quotient_le`: the quotient bound `μ · 2d · βM · βz` (assembled into
  `RhoShort` for the honest lifted witness by `rhoShort_honestLiftWitness` in
  `RingSwitch/Completeness`, where the honest witness is named).
* `Rq.lInftyNorm_le_half`, `rhoShort_half`: the *unconditional* fallback.
  Every element of `Rq Φ` has centered `ℓ∞` norm `≤ q/2`, so `RhoShort (q/2)` holds for **any**
  quotient family with no hypotheses at all. This is what makes the honest lift's `liftShort`
  obligation dischargeable for the Hachi chain, where the `R^lin` matrix contains the Ajtai key
  blocks `D`, `B`, `A` and the gadget powers `bᵉ` — none of them short, so `q/2` is the only honest
  `βM`. See `rhoShort_half`'s docstring for what that costs downstream.

/-! ## The quotient bound -/

/-- **Centered coefficient bound for the honest lift quotient**, at the concrete power-of-two
modulus `φ = X ^ d + 1`.

Every quotient coefficient *is* a row-sum coefficient of index `≥ d`
(`Polynomial.coeff_divByMonic_X_pow_add_one`, valid because the dividend has degree `≤ 2d − 2`), and
`rep yᵢ` does not reach those indices. So the bound is the row-sum bound at index `< 2d`, i.e.
`μ · 2d · βM · βz` — division contributes **no growth at all**.

Hypotheses: the modulus shape `hφ`, positivity `hd`, and the two explicit coefficient bounds `hM`
(the `R^lin` matrix) and `hz` (the witness). No anti-wraparound condition. -/

/-- **The unconditional fallback: `RhoShort (q/2)` holds for every quotient family.** Centered
representatives live in `(−q/2, q/2]`, so this needs no hypotheses whatsoever.

It is the bound the Hachi chain actually uses, and that is a substantive statement about the
construction rather than laziness: `rlinStmt` assembles its matrix from the Ajtai key blocks `D`,
`B`, `A` and the gadget powers `bᵉ`, all of which are (or may be) uniform mod `q`, so the honest
`βM` of `rhoShort_honestLiftWitness` is `q/2` and the growth bound `μ · 2d · (q/2) · βz` exceeds
`q/2` — i.e. the honest quotient of a Hachi `R^lin` instance is *not* short, and no sharper claim is
available without assuming a short commitment key.

**Why the digit encoding is necessary rather than decorative.** A range table checking these raw
rows against a single base `b` would need `b − 1 ≥ q/2`, degenerating the parameters.
`ZeroCheck/Constraints` therefore range-checks the quotient's base-`b` **digits**, which are
`⌊b/2⌋`-bounded outright (`rhoDigits_valMinAbs_natAbs_le`). -/
