  # Hachi's `Lift` instance (Figure 4 / Lemma 9)

  This file is the **cyclotomic instance** of generic `Lift`
  (`ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Lift/`): the presentation is `Rq Φ` with canonical
  reduced representatives (`cyclotomicPresentation`, laws discharged from the `Rq` quotient
  bridge in `Data/Lattices/CyclotomicRing/QuotientLift.lean`). The generic layers supply
  everything construction-shaped: the lifted witness and `checkAt` predicate, the
  `2d`-point interpolation/descent recovery, the escape/collision/common-opening extractor,
  and the CWSS plumbing. The composable package is therefore assembled **wholesale from generic
  `Lift.package`** at `cyclotomicPresentation`; the single Hachi-specific obligation handed to it
  is the norm implication `vecLInftyNorm_le_of_liftShort`. (See the note above `liftPackage` on
  why the CWSS certificate is exposed as `liftPackage.isCWSS` rather than a standalone theorem in
  Hachi's relation vocabulary.)

  The data that is genuinely specific to Hachi stays here:

  * the coefficient/norm bounds on the lifted witness (`RhoShort`, `liftShort`);
  * how the `R^lin` statement carries its public norm bound (`zOk`/`sideCond` instantiation);
  * the weak-binding `w̃`-commitment interface (`LiftCom`, whose short-collision set
    `LiftCom.Collision` is the escape event's hardness target).

  The name **Lift** refers to turning equality modulo `Φ.φ` into an exact polynomial
  equality with an explicit quotient witness. Its sibling is **Packing**, which instead
  encodes a basis-sized block of small-field coefficients as one large-field coefficient.

  This is intentionally a sibling of the DP24/Binius `Packing` switch
  (`ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Packing/`), not an instance of `RingSwitchingProfile`:
  packing a small-field polynomial into a larger field and evaluating a quotient presentation
  are different algebraic constructions (see the taxonomy in
  `ProofSystem/RingSwitching/Basic.lean`).

  Output relation `relLift`: an opening `w̃` of `t` whose lifted rows vanish at `α` and which is
  short. **CWSS at `k = 2d`** (`scalarStructure`, plain special soundness): each row's defect
  polynomial `∑ⱼ Mᵢⱼ·zⱼ − yᵢ − (X^d+1)·ρᵢ` has degree `≤ 2d − 1`, so `2d` accepting branches at
  pairwise-distinct `α` either exhibit two distinct short openings of `t` — the weak-binding
  **escape event** `CommittedScalar.escEvent` (`LiftCom.Collision`; [NOZ26] Remark 2 / Lemma 7) —
  or share one opening whose row defects have `2d` roots, hence vanish identically: `M z = y` over
  `Rq` plus the range bound, i.e. `relRlin` membership.

  Both halves of that argument are **proven generically**, one layer up: the interpolation descent
  is `RingSwitching.Lift.recover` over an arbitrary `Presentation`, and the collision/extraction
  dispatch is `CommittedScalar.mkWitness_mem`. This file supplies only the cyclotomic
  presentation (`cyclotomicPresentation`, `isPresentation_cyclotomic`), the challenge-local
  predicate (`liftCheckAt`), the norm bookkeeping (`vecLInftyNorm_le_of_liftShort`), and the
  resulting `liftPackage`.

  ## The commitment `LiftCom` and the norm bookkeeping

  The interface is abstract, so `LiftCom` carries nothing but `{TCom, com}` over its
  shortness index; `hachiLiftCom` below is the concrete Ajtai instantiation the nonrecursive
  chain runs at (see `Hachi/Concrete.lean`).
  Weak binding is **norm-conditioned**, hence that index: this chain instantiates
  `Short := liftShort bound bDig` at the *global* norm parameters, and the short-collision set
  `LiftCom.Collision` — the target of the escape event — reads it. `relLift`
  therefore carries (i) `liftShort bound bDig w̃` — feeding
  both the collision argument and, (ii) via the public sanity conjunct `bound ≤ s.bound`, the
  statement-level `R^lin` bound of the extraction target (assembled statements have
  `s.bound = γ = bound`, so completeness is unaffected). At the concrete instantiation
  `hachiLiftCom`, a short collision is a Module-SIS solution for the key `D`
  (`moduleSIS_relation_of_mem_Collision`).

  ## Paper-model boundary — closed

  Figure 4's *simplified* presentation commits to `(z, r)`; the full protocol decomposes the
  quotient into short base-`b` digits before commitment. That decomposition lives **here**:
  `rhoDigits` (`RingSwitch/RhoDigits.lean`) is the encoding, `liftMessage` commits it, and
  `RhoDigitsShort` is the admissibility it satisfies — unconditionally, at radius `⌊b/2⌋`
  (`rhoDigitsShort_of_digitBaseOk`). `RhoShort` is the vocabulary of the *raw* quotient growth
  bounds in `QuotientNorms.lean`, which the encoding makes irrelevant to the commitment.

/-- Coefficient-range predicate on the **raw** quotient polynomials.

Not part of `liftShort`: the committed vector carries the quotient's base-`b` digits, not the
quotient itself, so admissibility there is `RhoDigitsShort`. This predicate is the vocabulary of the
raw coefficient-growth bounds in `RingSwitch/QuotientNorms.lean` — statements about how large an
*undecomposed* quotient can get. It is what `rhoShort_half` bounds, and that bound's `q/2` is
exactly the parameter degeneracy the digit encoding avoids. -/

/-- Coefficient-range predicate on the quotient **digits** ([NOZ26] §4.3): every coefficient of
every base-`b` digit of every quotient row is `bound`-bounded.

This is what the committed vector's quotient block actually contains, so this — not `RhoShort` — is
the half of `liftShort` that the Eq. (20) range check certifies and that bounds the Module-SIS
escape target. Unlike `RhoShort ρBound`, it is satisfiable at `bound = O(b)`: by
`rhoDigits_valMinAbs_natAbs_le` the balanced digits of an *arbitrary* quotient are `⌊b/2⌋`-bounded,
with no shortness hypothesis on the quotient at all. -/
def RhoDigitsShort (bound bDig : ℕ) (ρ : Fin n → CPolynomial (ZMod q)) : Prop :=
  ∀ (i : Fin n) (u : Fin (rhoDigitCount q bDig)) (k : ℕ),
    ((rhoDigits Φ bDig (ρ i) (u : ℕ)).coeff k).valMinAbs.natAbs ≤ bound

/-- **Admissibility of a digit base** at a given norm bound. Three conditions, bundled because
every link that consumes the digit encoding needs exactly this triple:

* `one_lt` — a base of `0` or `1` is not a decomposition (`rhoDigits_reconstruct`);
* `le_half` — anti-wraparound, so a balanced digit *is* the centered representative
  (`balancedZmodDigit_valMinAbs_mem`);
* `radius_le` — the digit radius `⌊bDig/2⌋` fits inside the declared bound.

Under them the quotient half of `liftShort` costs nothing at all
(`rhoDigitsShort_of_digitBaseOk`), for an arbitrary quotient. That is the parameter choice stated
as a hypothesis class: with the raw quotient the corresponding condition was
`q/2 ≤ bound` (`rhoShort_half`), which is what pinned `γ = q/2 = bZero − 1`. -/

This is the exact counterpart of `rhoShort_half` (`QuotientNorms.lean`), and the contrast is the
parameter choice in one line: the raw quotient could only be bounded by `q/2`, its digits are
bounded by `⌊b/2⌋ = O(b)`. -/

every entry of the committed vector `z ‖ digits(ρ)` — the paper's weak-opening condition
`S_b` (Fig. 3 / Lemma 7).

A single bound suffices because the quotient block is committed as digits (see `RhoDigitsShort`).
Committing it raw would need a second, separate bound, and that bound could only be `q/2`
(`rhoShort_half`), forcing `γ = bZero − 1 = q/2` and emptying both the range check and the escape
target of content. -/

/-! ### The concrete Ajtai instantiation of `LiftCom`

`hachiLiftCom` replaces the abstract commitment by the Eq. (16)-shaped Ajtai product, so the
nonrecursive chain has a `TCom` and a `com` an implementation can actually compute. Everything
here is a plain `def`: `Rq Φ` has a computable `CommRing` instance, `Simple.commit` is
`matVecMul`, and the quotient rows enter through `CPolynomial.coeff` — computable coefficient
arrays all the way down.

**Why the lift needs its own key.** The obvious candidate for the matrix is `pp.dMatrix`, the
Eq. (16) short-commitment matrix that `keygen` already samples and that the `R^lin` statement's
c1 row consumes (`rlin_linear_iff`). Its width is wrong: `PublicParamsD.dMatrix` has
`blocks * messageDigits = rlinCW` columns — the *carrier slice* `ŵ` alone — whereas the committed
vector of a lifted witness is `μ + n·δ` ring elements (`μ = rlinCW + (rlinCT + rlinCZ)` for the
`R^lin` witness `z`, plus `δ = clog_b q` digit rows per quotient row). Committing under
`pp.dMatrix` would therefore have to drop `ρ` and two thirds of `z`, leaving a commitment whose
`LiftCom.Collision` set is enormous and carries no Module-SIS content. The c1 commitment and the
lift's commitment are different objects: c1 constrains the carrier decomposition inside the
statement, the lift binds the whole opening. The key is therefore a parameter at the matching
width; sampling it in `keygen` alongside `D` would need a new `PublicParamsD` field. -/

/-- A quotient row of a lifted witness, read back as a ring element. The rows have degree
`≤ d − 1` (`LiftedWitness.hρ`), so the reduced representative of degree `< d` loses nothing —
this is a change of presentation, not a reduction. Computable: `CPolynomial.coeff` reads the
coefficient array, and `Rq.ofFinCoeff` builds the representative directly. -/
def rhoAsRq (p : CPolynomial (ZMod q)) : Rq Φ :=
  Rq.ofFinCoeff Φ Φ.φ.natDegree p.coeff

/-- Entry `j` of the quotient block of the committed vector: `j` is the flattened `(row, digit)`
index, split by `finProdFinEquiv` into row `j / δ` and digit `j % δ` — the same flattening the
gadget matrix uses (`gadgetEntry_finProdFinEquiv`), so the block is laid out digit-major within
each row, exactly as `wTable`'s widened quotient rows read it. -/

/-- The message an Ajtai lift commitment binds: the `R^lin` witness `z`, followed by the `n·δ`
**digits** of the quotient rows. This is [NOZ26] §4.3's `(z, r₁, …, r_δ)`, the encoding the paper
commits to and then drops the digit subscript from ("there is a hidden gadget decomposition
of `r`").

Committing the digits rather than Figure 4's raw `(z, r)` is the whole point of the wire format:
every entry of the quotient block is `⌊b/2⌋`-bounded by construction
(`rhoDigits_valMinAbs_natAbs_le`), so `LiftCom.Collision` is a *short* kernel problem for `D`. With
the raw quotient the block was only `q/2`-bounded, and the Module-SIS target was trivially
solvable. -/

/-- **The concrete lift commitment**: the Ajtai product `D · (z ‖ ρ)` at a key of the matching

  com := fun w => Simple.commit Φ D (liftMessage Φ bDig w)

/-! ### What the digit encoding buys the escape target

The point of committing digits rather than the raw quotient, stated rather than left implicit:
*every* coordinate of the committed vector of a short opening is bounded by the single norm
parameter `bound`, so a short collision satisfies `ModuleSIS.relation` for the key `D` at radius
`2·bound` — nonzero, short, and in the kernel
(`moduleSIS_relation_of_mem_Collision`, via `liftMessage_injective`).

Under Figure 4's simplified wire format this fails where it matters. A quotient block of raw rows
has only the unconditional bound `q/2` (`rhoShort_half`, and sharp — the `R^lin` matrix carries the
Ajtai key blocks), so the collision set would contain pairs differing by a vector of `ℓ∞` norm up to
`q`: no restriction at all over `ZMod q`, leaving `LiftCom.Collision` trivially inhabited by
short-in-name-only openings and undischargeable by any Module-SIS assumption. -/

/-- The **sole Hachi-specific obligation** of Lemma 9 in the generic-consumption model: the
norm implication. A short lifted witness (`‖z‖∞ ≤ bound`) at a statement whose public bound
dominates (`bound ≤ s.bound`) has `‖z‖∞ ≤ s.bound`. This is exactly generic `Lift`'s
`short_zOk` hypothesis; the interpolation/descent recovery and the escape/collision extractor
are supplied by the generic layer. -/

/-- Hachi's `Lift` instance as a composable CWSS package, reusing the generic ring-switching
`Lift.package` at the cyclotomic presentation. Hachi supplies only the presentation data
(`cyclotomicPresentation`/`isPresentation_cyclotomic`) and the norm implication
(`vecLInftyNorm_le_of_liftShort`); the CWSS certificate is `liftPackage.isCWSS`.

**Why the certificate is a package field, not a standalone theorem.** `isCWSS` is the uniform
`EscapeCWSSPackage` field (`.../CoordinateWiseSpecialSoundness/Escape.lean`), and it is the field —
not any named theorem — that the chain composition operator `▷` consumes: every link in the Hachi
opening chain (`QuadEval/Bridge.lean`, `QuadEval/Soundness.lean`, `Sumcheck/Rounds.lean`,
`ZeroCheck/Reduction.lean`, …) exposes its certificate the same way,
and `iteration.isCWSS` is assembled from them in `Composition.lean`. Because this package is
built wholesale from generic `Lift.package`, its certificate already arrives in that shape, stated
in the generic `Lift` vocabulary. Restating it as a standalone theorem over Hachi's own
`relRlin`/`relLift` at `Rq Φ` would duplicate the proposition without adding content and would sit
outside the composition
interface, so nothing would consume it. -/
