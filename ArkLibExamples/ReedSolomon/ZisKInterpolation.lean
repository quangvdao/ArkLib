# ZisK first-order interpolation certificates

This module checks every interpolation profile in `goldilocks-beyond-poseidon.json`: the initial
Poseidon2 powers row and the five folding rows on domains of sizes `65536`, `8192`, `1024`, `128`,
and `32`.

For each line row, Lean evaluates the exact finite first-order support data and the shifted
graded-row surplus

```text
firstOrderCurveShiftedRowSlotBound (k - 1) A m M mu n 1 h
  < firstOrderCurveShiftedHeightSlotCount (k - 1) A m M mu 1 h.
```

The full-support constructor turns this numerical surplus into a primitive symbolic
interpolant over `F[Z]`.  Its specialization remains nonzero over every extension field, and every
degree-`< k` polynomial agreeing with the specialized received line at `A` positions satisfies
the resulting differential equation.

The initial degree-181 row additionally checks the polynomial-curve surplus at height 22707 and
constructs that curve certificate. The folding rows expose their affine-line certificates.
