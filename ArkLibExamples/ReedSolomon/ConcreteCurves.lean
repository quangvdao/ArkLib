# Exact polynomial-curve interpolation for ZisK and LambdaVM

The interpolation equation must hold on the polynomial received curve used by powers
batching, not only on an affine line. At batching degree `ℓ`, every source column with
`Y₀` exponent `a` consumes `ℓ * a` degrees in the challenge. This module checks that
stronger finite height test at the exact heights recorded in the concrete certificates.

The ZisK family contains its initial degree-181 curve and all five folds. The LambdaVM
family contains all five equality-table configurations from the paper, with their initial
degree-17 curves and every binary fold down to domain size 256. Rows are ordered first by
increasing initial table size and then by decreasing folding domain size.

## Reading the statements

For each row, the field, domain embedding, and received curve are arbitrary. The only
condition on the received curve is its pointwise challenge-degree bound. The constructed
single equation is primitive, has the recorded support and height, and has a nonzero
specialization vanishing on every sufficiently agreeing candidate of degree below `k`,
over every extension field. Thus batching degree is proved data, not descriptive metadata.

These are the interpolation inputs to the geometric transfer. Exceptional-set counts and
query error estimates are distinct conclusions and are not asserted by this module.
