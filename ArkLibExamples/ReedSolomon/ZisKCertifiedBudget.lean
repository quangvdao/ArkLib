# Derived ZisK curve counts and their local error budgets

Each of the six curves supplies its actual exceptional set over cubic Goldilocks. The initial
row uses one bit of batching grinding; the five folding rows use no grinding.

## Reading the statements

The domain and all received constituent words are arbitrary. Each row chooses one finite
exceptional set before the challenge and close candidate. Outside it, the candidate is
exactly a power combination of base-field messages with the same full agreement set.
The accompanying inequality checks the corresponding local algebraic error slot.

## Paper correspondence and entry point

Read `exists_exceptional_at_target` for the six curve rows in the paper's ZisK subsection.
`i = 0` is the initial powers batching; the other five indices are folding rows.
`Fin r` means an index with `r` possible values, and `↪` requires distinct evaluation points.
The arbitrary `values` are the received constituent words, not assumed polynomial messages.
The theorem constructs the exceptional set from this data before considering any challenge or
candidate. Its last clause recovers polynomial messages with equality of the full agreement sets.

`algebraicSlot` is the paper's batching/folding contribution `E / (g q)`: only the initial row
has `g = 2`. The definition records the one-bit grinding allowance in the analytical model;
it does not assert that the deployed transcript implements that allowance.
`ZisK.query_at_target` separately proves the 111-query inequality with the existing 16 grinding
bits. `replacement_payload_strict` compares the removed responses with the added nonce.

These are per-phase mathematical bounds and the pinned response-size model. The existing
16 query-grinding bits are unchanged. Adding the batching nonce requires the transcript
hook described in the application discussion; no deployed verifier is modeled here.
