# ArkLib Agent Guide

Lean 4 formalization of SNARK-related theory, interactive oracle reductions, and proof systems.
Start with [`README.md`](README.md) for project overview.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical root guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Fast Start

1. For a convenient routine check, start with `./scripts/validate.sh`.
   Before committing or pushing, run it in full; it enforces repository-wide non-`sorry` warnings
   and the Lean-native source-policy gate across `ArkLib/` and `ArkLibTest/`. It also runs `lake test` and rejects all test warnings.
2. On a cold clone, run `lake exe cache get` first.
3. If you add, rename, or delete files under `ArkLib/`, `git add` new paths before validation.
4. For docstring or docs work, `./scripts/validate.sh --docs` is a convenient add-on check.
5. Only build site or blueprint output when touching `blueprint/` or `home_page/`:
   `./scripts/validate.sh --site`.
6. When filling or adding a `sorry` (or anything that must stay axiom-clean), run
   `./scripts/validate.sh --axioms`; it first certifies the sweep tool against its
   fixture matrix (`./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh`), then runs the regression gate.
   Refresh `scripts/axiom_baseline.json` with `lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline`
   and commit the diff if the change is intentional. The baseline covers `sorryAx`
   debt only — native-compiler trust is never allowlistable.

## Where To Work

- `ArkLib/Data/` - reusable math, coding theory, polynomials, and supporting definitions.
- `ArkLibTest/` - compile-time acceptance examples and regression tests; run `lake test`.
- `ArkLib/Interaction/` - typed interactions and dependent reduction foundations.
- `ArkLib/OracleReduction/` - legacy IOR abstractions and security theory.
- `ArkLib/ProofSystem/` - protocol formalizations built on the core.
- `ArkLib/Commitments/` - commitments and opening arguments.
- `ArkLib/ToMathlib/` - local extensions intended for upstreaming.
- `blueprint/src/` - deep design docs and bibliography.
- `scripts/` - repo utilities.

## Guardrails

- Lean defaults: `autoImplicit = false`; source files must remain at or below 1500 lines.
- Source-policy exceptions and linter suppressions are not supported. Fix the source or improve the
  linter with a repository-wide, tested policy change.
- `ArkLib.lean` is generated; do not hand-edit it.
- Edit source, not derived output such as `.lake/`, `blueprint/web/`, `blueprint/print/`,
  `dependency_graphs/`, or `home_page/docs/`.
- Pre-existing `sorry` blocks exist in active formalizations; distinguish existing gaps from new
  regressions.
- Prefer proof scripts that expose the key mathematical steps and compose predictably. Broad
  automation is welcome when it closes a well-scoped goal quickly and clearly; for a slow proof,
  profile first, then narrow imports, local hypotheses, simp sets, or automation rules, or move a
  recurring argument into its owner layer. Do not mechanically expand a short, stable terminal
  `simp` into a brittle `simp only` list.
- If a PR changes commands, repo structure, generated outputs, or the blueprint/citation
  workflow, update the matching page in [`docs/wiki/`](docs/wiki/README.md) in the same PR.
- Promote recurring agent learnings into [`docs/wiki/`](docs/wiki/README.md); do not let stable
  guidance live only in ephemeral notes.
