# Tight first-order curve stage-charge acceptance tests

These examples cover the common-exponent boundary and the degenerate cap schedules used by the
finite first-order curve bound.

/-- Natural subtraction gives the tight common exponent one when `K = 2`. -/
example : 2 * (2 : ℕ) - 3 = 1 := by omega

/-- That tight exponent is sufficient for the order-one Taylor chart. -/
example : TaylorExponentSufficient 1 2 (2 * 2 - 3) :=

/-- Full stage charges promote from order zero to order one when all three ratios and the
accidental-agreement factor are in their geometric ranges. -/
