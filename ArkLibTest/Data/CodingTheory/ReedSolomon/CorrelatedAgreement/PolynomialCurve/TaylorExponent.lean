# Tight polynomial-curve degree formula tests

These examples ensure the sharp regular-stage formulas use the supplied common Taylor exponent,
including the `K = 2` boundary.

/-- At `K = 2`, the tight exponent gives challenge degree `ell + h`. -/
example : sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree 3 2 5 (τ := 2 * 2 - 3) = 8 := by
  norm_num [sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree]

/-- At `K = 2`, the same exponent gives jet degree `v`. -/
example : sourceCurveCutJetDegree 2 4 (τ := 2 * 2 - 3) = 4 := by
  norm_num [sourceCurveCutJetDegree]

/-- The tight order-zero mixed degree uses `h*b + v*a`. -/
example : sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeOne 3 2 4 5 (τ := 1) = 52 := by
  norm_num [sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeOne, sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree,
    sourceCurveCutJetDegree]

/-- The tight order-one mixed degree uses `h*b^2 + 2*v*a*b`. -/
example : sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo 3 2 4 5 (τ := 1) = 336 := by
  norm_num [sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo, sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree,
    sourceCurveCutJetDegree]

/-- The arbitrary-order formula specializes to the order-one formula. -/
example : sourceCurveInitialMixedDegree 1 3 2 4 5 (τ := 1) =
    sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo 3 2 4 5 (τ := 1) := by
  norm_num [sourceCurveInitialMixedDegree, sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo,
    sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree, sourceCurveCutJetDegree]

/-- The strengthened order-one budget accepts an independent direct joint factor. -/
example : regularSymbolicCurveMCASharpBoundTwo 11 3 2 3 5 8 4 5
    (τ := 1) (η := 3 / 2) = 1746 := by
  norm_num [regularSymbolicCurveMCASharpBoundTwo, sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo,
    sourceCurveCutChallengeDegree, sourceCurveCutJetDegree]

/-- The direct factor improves the temporary square-factor compatibility budget. -/
example : regularSymbolicCurveMCASharpBoundTwo 11 3 2 3 5 8 4 5
    (τ := 1) (η := 3 / 2) ≤
      regularSymbolicCurveMCASharpBoundTwo 11 3 2 3 5 8 4 5 (τ := 1) := by
  norm_num [regularSymbolicCurveMCASharpBoundTwo, sourceCurveInitialMixedDegreeTwo,
