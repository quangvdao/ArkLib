# ChiesaYogev2024

## At A Glance

Alessandro Chiesa and Eylon Yogev's *Building Cryptographic Proofs from Hash Functions* is a
required long-term coverage target for ArkLib's interaction framework. The ambition is to
formalize the book in ArkLib's language, including its more general reductions and dependent
interfaces. It is not enough to reuse the book's terminology for a different security experiment.

The repository bibliography retains its 2024 key. The comparison below uses version 1.2 of
March 25, 2026, at the pinned source revision in the metadata.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

The book provides concrete security experiments and a modular route from oracle proofs to
hash-based arguments: round-by-round and state-restoration security, interactive compilation
using commitments, hash-chain Fiat-Shamir, and knowledge extraction with explicit losses.
It also covers material outside this route, including zero knowledge, preprocessing and witness
indistinguishability. Whole-book coverage remains an ambition, not a completed theorem inventory.

The [detailed comparison and research notes](../audits/chiesa-yogev-interaction.md) distinguish
source definitions, implemented results, proposed bridges and unanswered design questions.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [Native interaction protocols](../../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/Protocol.lean) and
  [runtime soundness](../../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/RuntimeSoundness.lean) supply execution
  and reduction semantics, including persistent oracle state.
- [Native Sumcheck soundness](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Sumcheck/Interaction/ProtocolSoundness.lean)
  is an ordinary-security client, not yet a formalization of the book's whole security pipeline.
- [Legacy round-by-round security](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/RoundByRound.lean)
  contains both execution-averaged and fixed-prefix notions; their knowledge variants need
  separate access and timing comparisons.
- [Legacy transcript-tree extraction](../../../ArkLib/OracleReduction/Security/TranscriptTree/Composition.lean)
  contains reusable mathematical composition results, distinct from an efficient tree-finding
  algorithm with black-box prover access.
- The [roadmap](../../design/05-roadmap.md#bounded-interaction-theory-investigation)
  records the proposed first bounded investigation.

## Known Divergences From ArkLib

ArkLib has dependent interaction trees, output claims and virtual oracle interfaces, refined
message types, and explicit shared-state execution. The book's relevant IOP experiments use
fixed-round strings and precisely specified randomness and extractor observations. Some
differences are useful generalizations; others are missing specialization or compiler proofs.
The detailed comparison records which is which rather than assuming equivalence.
