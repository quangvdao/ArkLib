# Source Metadata

Each paper may have a source metadata directory under:

- `docs/kb/sources/KEY/`

The minimal committed artifact is usually:

- `metadata.yml`

Optional additional artifacts include:

- extracted plaintext or markdown;
- a local PDF when redistribution is acceptable;
- source-specific notes for reviewers or agents.

Non-paper sources may also have a directory here when their provenance materially affects an
ArkLib development. Use a stable source name and explain why it is not a BibTeX-keyed paper
record. For example, [`rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md`](rs-ld-mca/PERMISSION.md) records permission and
commit-level provenance for an external Lean formalization adapted by the Reed–Solomon project.

The metadata should record:

- source URL;
- source type;
- version/provenance notes;
- whether a local artifact is committed.

A permission record must distinguish a project-owner attestation from direct grantor evidence
and must not infer a license merely because a source repository is public.
