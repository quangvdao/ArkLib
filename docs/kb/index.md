# Knowledge Base Index

This is the main catalog for ArkLib's knowledge base. Every BibTeX key cited from `ArkLib/` has a
page under [`papers/`](papers/README.md); that directory, not this list, is the authoritative set.

## Generated Registries

- [`_generated/references.json`](_generated/references.json) - normalized export of
  `blueprint/src/references.bib`.
- [`_generated/lean-citations.json`](_generated/lean-citations.json) - generated map from
  `ArkLib/**/*.lean` to cited BibTeX keys.
