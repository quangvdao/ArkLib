# Interaction and oracle-reduction design

This suite explains how ArkLib represents interactive protocols, states their security, and plans
the remaining formalization. It is written for readers familiar with provers, verifiers, oracles,
and soundness. **Status updated: 2026-10-03.**

A protocol is an interaction tree with prover and verifier strategies. The prover's continuation
keeps its private memory. An oracle reduction returns a statement and an oracle interface: the
next reduction can query that interface without seeing the underlying prover messages. Security
relates the input claim to this output claim. When execution uses a persistent oracle, the same
world state and query history continue across the boundary.

compiler chapters below; finish with the roadmap. File numbers identify chapters, not a second
implementation schedule.

## Chapters and their responsibilities

| Page | Owns |
|---|---|
| [Current status](00-current-status.md) | Supported dependency pins, available APIs, proved results, and remaining proof gaps |
| [End state](00-end-state.md) | Intended coverage and what counts as completing the framework |
| [Foundations](01-foundations.md) | Division of responsibility between PolyFun, VCVio, and ArkLib |
| [Foundation implementation record](01a-foundation-pr-plan.md) | Historical AR slice identifiers and the PRs that delivered them |
| [Type-tree naming](01b-type-tree-rename-cutover.md) | The completed rename and correspondence between generic and oracle trees |
| [Access and execution contract](01c-access-execution-contract.md) | What the verifier can observe and query at each protocol position |
| [Claims, closing, and composition](02-oracle-reduction-core.md) | Output interfaces, their interpretation, and execution conditions for composition |
| [Execution and security](03-adversarial-oracle-execution.md) | Persistent worlds, security events, probability premises, extraction, and costs |
| [Oracle-elimination compiler](04-oracle-elimination-compiler.md) | Backend obligations and how compilation preserves oracle guarantees |
| [Roadmap](05-roadmap.md) | The single active implementation sequence, dependencies, acceptance checks, and issue links |

The [naming guide](../wiki/interaction-naming.md) governs declaration names, docstrings, and
explanations. State the mathematical result and its assumptions before implementation details.
Use familiar cryptographic terms, and explain additional terms where they first matter.

## How to maintain this suite

Record a design decision in its owning architecture chapter. Record a proposed PR and its
acceptance check in the roadmap. Update current status when the corresponding API or theorem changes, explicitly identifying
merged results and reviewed open PRs. [Issue #1](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib/issues/1) links the work items; their issues
record progress and implementation PRs. Do not add another parallel plan or repeat an issue's
progress log across chapters.

The pages distinguish three kinds of statement:

- **Implemented or proved:** supported by the source at the pins recorded in current status.
- **Planned:** an intended theorem or API, with its implementation work in the roadmap.
- **Conditional or deferred:** work needing a concrete client or a later milestone.

Architecture chapters specify intended contracts; a design signature is not evidence that the
corresponding declaration exists. Consult current status for the implemented boundary.

Earlier audits and prototypes remain on
[the preserved design archive](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib/tree/archive/oracle-reduction-v2-pre-split/docs/design/archive)
and in Git history. They are historical evidence, not current implementation instructions.
