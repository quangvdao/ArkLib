# Separating RS mathematics from executable cost proofs

Status: proposed implementation plan, inspected at `e3567c1c` on
`quang/all-rate-rs-capacity-formalization`, 2026-09-05. No Lean changes are implied
by this document. Audience: the mathematics/MCA orchestrator, the decoder
orchestrator, and reviewers of the computational claim.

The recommendation is to separate the mathematical theorems from executable
realization, then prove the existing decoder runs in a small, explicitly defined
algebraic machine. Do not reorganize the entire branch or rebuild the decoder.
Do not make binary arithmetic or a Turing-machine backend a prerequisite.

## What is already proved, and what this revision adds

[Capacity.lean](../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/AllRateListDecoding/Capacity.lean)
contains both an exact-list existence theorem and
`capacity_decoder_exact_output_and_primitive_work`. The latter connects the
actual coordinate decoder's output to the specification and bounds its returned
primitive-work ledger. These proofs remain useful.

The missing claim is that an execution in a restricted machine has that output
and a comparable cost. A Lean function returning `(answer, cost)` does not impose
this restriction: its body could perform uncharged computation. Adding a monad
or a cost field without restricting its operations would not fix that problem.

The new proof should connect three distinct claims:

1. The output consists exactly of the sufficiently agreeing polynomials.
2. A particular algebraic program produces the existing decoder's output.
3. Its operationally defined execution cost has the required bound.

The mathematics orchestrator can strengthen list bounds and prove mutual
correlated agreement (MCA) independently of items 2 and 3.

## Target dependency structure

Arrows below mean “provides results to,” not Lean import direction.

                           Public decoder theorem and bridges
```

Keep the paper-facing full theorem in `Capacity.lean`. Give its purely
mathematical list theorem a lightweight owner module, with compatibility exports
through `Capacity.lean`. The full capstone is deliberately allowed to import both
sides; MCA development should import the mathematical owner, not the capstone.

The existing
[ListDecoding/Specification.lean](../../ArkLib/Data/CodingTheory/ReedSolomon/ListDecoding/Specification.lean)
is already an extensional, cost-free specification. Reuse it where appropriate.
An extensional decoder certificate alone does not supply an algorithm.

## First integration patch: remove the actual import leaks

These are small extractions, not a directory migration. Proposed new filenames
below do not yet exist.

| Current dependency | Revision | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SymbolicReceivedInterpolation` imports `LocalColumnTranslationSemantics` for `LocalColumnTranslationMachine.sourceColumn` | Move that polynomial definition into proposed `HiddenDerivative/SourceColumn.lean`; import it and `LocalConstraintMap` directly from symbolic interpolation | Mathematical consumers no longer import column execution; original semantics still compiles |
| `TaylorAllSolutions` and `GeometricBandParameters` import `SeparantChainRefinement` for `jetDegree_le_total` and `separant_total_le` | Put those two purely mathematical lemmas in existing `TotalJetDegreeRootCount.lean`; update consumers | Taylor, characteristic-zero Taylor, and geometric bounds no longer import sparse execution through these lemmas |
| `Capacity.lean` combines pure lists and execution | Extract the pure public statement into proposed `AllRateListDecoding/CapacityList.lean`; leave full assembly in `Capacity.lean` | Same theorem type, lightweight mathematical import path |

Use intrinsic mathematical names in the new owner modules. Preserve old
qualified names with compatibility aliases where needed so other workers do not
have to chase renames. Do not replace the executable separant-chain relation:
the mathematical consumers need only the two degree lemmas, not that relation.

Integration owns this patch and publishes its commit hash before parallel edits
to affected files. Freeze shared signatures after that checkpoint.

## The computation model we will certify

Use a small first-order algebraic machine, not unrestricted Lean callbacks.
This is a design contract to finalize with the first vertical slice, not a claim
that the syntax below is already implemented.

- Programs have finite syntax: literals, primitive operations, branches, loops,
  and calls to finite, defined subprograms. There is no constructor accepting an
  arbitrary Lean function or predicate to evaluate for free.
- Values have explicit representations: field cells, scalar counters, booleans,
  and list/record cells. Structural operations inspect or construct boundedly
  many cells. Append, equality of lists, lookup by traversal, and copying are
  programs, not unit-cost bulk primitives.
- Fix the primitive menu before implementing the decoder. Field arithmetic,
  field equality, scalar arithmetic/comparison, and individual structural/control
  operations have specified charges. Decide division and conversion conventions
  explicitly. No polynomial evaluation, matrix elimination, root finding, or
  enumeration is a primitive.
- Scalar arithmetic is unit-cost abstract arithmetic, not bit arithmetic. Call
  the result an algebraic machine bound; do not claim a bounded-word RAM theorem
  unless word-size invariants are separately proved. Do not permit a bulk
  scalar-to-list or encoded-answer decoding primitive.
- Count control, calls, and materialization, or prove a constant-factor bound
  absorbing them. A field-operation count can be a separate projection of a
  resource vector; it is not a substitute for the total-machine-work claim.
- Inputs are materialized coordinate/received-value rows and integer parameters.
  Outputs are materialized coefficient lists. Their mathematical interpretation
  is a specification relation, not free execution of a polynomial algorithm.
- For each fixed gap, choose integer parameters and a fixed program before
  choosing block length, dimension, prime field, or received word. The real gap
  is not a runtime oracle. Do not assume an input-specific compiled program or
  precomputed alphabet, matrix, or answer.

The machine interpreter may be written using Lean functions. That is harmless
provided the *programs* cannot invoke arbitrary functions, and the transition
semantics specifies only the fixed primitive operations. This distinction is
what reduces the human audit surface.

## Realization strategy and the cost theorem

Keep the existing executable functions as a reference implementation. For each
routine, provide a machine program, a representation relation, and a theorem
that execution produces the same represented result. Prove cost composition
from the machine semantics, not from a caller-supplied annotation.

Aim for a bound of the schematic form

```text
machine steps ≤ c(d,m) × existing primitive work + setupBound(n,k,q,d,m,A).
```

This is a target to prove, not an assumed property of a new interface. Charge
setup explicitly and prove its absorption into the final bound. In particular,
audit support-enumeration fuel, powers used to calculate fuel, scalar dispatch,
interpreter administration, field/extension-coordinate enumeration, and output
collection. Either execute and charge fuel construction, or remove proof fuel
from the machine program and prove termination from the existing traces.

Preserve the requested leading exponents `2d` and `d`: constant-factor or
sufficiently low polynomial overhead can be absorbed in the existing absolute
additive exponent; a generic polynomial simulation might multiply `d` and is
not automatically acceptable. Prove the absorption, including the order-zero
branch where the executed multiplicity depends on block length. Do not hide
block-length dependence in a supposedly gap-only constant.

The final public statement should exhibit an actual machine program and its
terminating execution, exact output, list bound, and operational cost bound.
It must not accept an uninstantiated “all routines are efficiently realizable”
hypothesis. State explicitly that this is algebraic cost, not native Lean time
or binary complexity. Align manuscript wording separately before claiming that
a differently worded paper runtime theorem is fully formalized.

## Work packages and acceptance gates

These are dependency waves, not time promises. The first substantive vertical
slice determines whether the bulk realization work is affordable as designed.

| Package | Owner | Deliverable and acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Interface separation | Integration | The three extractions above; unchanged public theorem types; mathematical import closure excludes execution/cost modules |
| B. Machine and vertical slice | Machine worker | Restricted syntax, semantics, representations, cost composition; realize Horner evaluation inside a list traversal with a loop and a subroutine call; prove value agreement and cost bound |
| C. Interpolation realization | Interpolation worker | Support enumeration, local-column construction, elimination, and interpolation produce the reference outputs with operational bounds, including setup |
| D. Recovery realization | Recovery worker | Coordinate alphabets, separant chain, jet enumeration/lifting, filtering and duplicate handling produce the reference outputs with operational bounds |
| E. Decoder assembly | Integration | Actual dispatcher and exceptional branches; one exact-output machine theorem with both field regimes; absorb all overhead |
| F. Independent audit and cleanup | Reviewer, then integration | Audit primitive menu, representations, uniformity and capstone; run builds/axiom checks; update paper-facing documentation without overstating the computation model |

B is a gate before large-scale realization, not a parallel excuse to invent
incompatible local machine languages. During B, C and D can inventory routines,
define representation relations, and isolate existing semantic lemmas. After B,
C and D run independently against the frozen machine API.

Use at most three algorithm workers: machine, interpolation, recovery.
Integration coordinates and owns shared files. Rotate a completed worker into
independent review of code they did not author rather than expanding concurrency.
Do not launch these workers merely because this planning document exists.

## Ownership alongside the MCA orchestrator

The MCA orchestrator owns symbolic interpolation, rational Taylor geometry,
field-independent list mathematics, and the unfinished full MCA argument in
[the strengthening frontier](../../ALL_RATE_RS_STRENGTHENINGS_FRONTIER.md).
That includes challenge-dependent Taylor charts, image/generic-fiber bounds,
incidence accounting, exceptional challenges, and remaining small dimensions.
It does not wait for the algorithmic machine.

The algorithm orchestrator owns executable routines, machine semantics, cost
bounds, and execution-specific refinement files. Shared mathematical root-finding
files are allocated by exact filename, not by a blanket directory claim.

Integration owns `Capacity.lean`, `GeometricOutputBounds.lean`, shared
specifications, and the initial extraction commit. Generic stronger list bounds
attach through exactness/cardinality bridges; MCA itself requires its own
mathematical proof and is not supplied by decoder exactness.

Each worker records its base commit, writable files, deliverable, and acceptance
check before editing. Use separate worktrees/build directories and integrate
onto the single central branch. Request interface changes through integration;
do not silently change another lane's assumptions. Report verified checkpoints
and blockers, not routine progress chatter.

## Review and completion checklist

- Check transitive imports of `SymbolicReceivedInterpolation`,
  `TaylorAllSolutions`, `TaylorCharZeroSolutions`, and `GeometricCodewordBound`.
  Enforce the boundary with an import-closure test, not just filename conventions.
- Compile changed owners, original execution consumers, and public capstones.
  Check theorem types and axiom dependencies; add no admissions or assumptions
  that replace the algorithmic proof obligation.
- Review the primitive syntax and transition semantics line by line. Check that
  bulk computation cannot enter via an opaque callback, a conversion, an input
  representation, or an unproved realization instance.
- Check every executed path, including exceptional/failed branches as specified.
  Use small executable examples as regression tests, not as complexity proofs.
- Audit the quantifier order, representation relation, output completeness,
  gap-only constants, and both final exponents independently.
- Run repository validation before commits/pushes, and the axiom gate for proof
  changes. Do not run competing builds in the same writable build directory.
- Retain useful internal lemmas and compatibility APIs. Defer broad file moves,
  incidental renames, binary backends, and a general verified Lean compiler.

Completion means reviewers can inspect a small machine definition and a clear
public theorem, while Lean checks the intervening realization proofs. It does
not mean nobody needs to review specifications or modelling choices. It means
reviewers no longer have to trust every algorithm's handwritten cost annotation.
