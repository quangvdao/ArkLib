# 00 — End State: A Verified Architecture for SNARKs

## 0. Status and scope

This document is a **north star and coverage contract**, not a claim that every proof system has
already been reduced to one carrier. The near-term scope is classical hash-, algebraic-, and
lattice-based proof systems under explicitly stated oracle and adversary models. Quantum access,
relativized relations that query the model's own random oracle, and other execution models require
new semantics; the architecture must leave seams for them without pretending that the classical
core already covers them.

The original design was developed on `design/oracle-reduction-v2`. That branch and the preserved
`archive/oracle-reduction-v2-pre-split` branch are documentation and prototype provenance,
**not implementation bases**. At the 2026-07-13 audit the design branch forked from ArkLib at
`9f6e989` and carried the older core-rebuild tree. Prototype declarations may be transplanted only
as reviewed source material onto the current default branch.

The supported toolchain and exact PolyFun/VCVio revisions are recorded in
[`00-current-status.md`](00-current-status.md). That status page supersedes the original Lean 4.31
migration candidate and July dependency inventory; the historical hashes remain useful only for
interpreting the archived prototype.

## 1. The ambition

ArkLib should become the integration library in which a broad range of SNARK constructions can be
stated, composed, compiled, and connected to executable implementations:

- hash-based protocols such as FRI, STIR, WHIR, BaseFold, Binius, and BCS/Micali compilers;
- algebraic systems such as KZG/PLONK, IPA/Bulletproofs, Nova/ProtoStar folding, pairing-based
  systems, and protocols proved in the AGM;
- lattice-based commitments and arguments, including Ajtai-style commitments and structured
  lattice reductions;
- recursion, IVC, PCD, aggregation, preprocessing, and executable refinement.

This is a **coverage hypothesis** tested by conformance cases, not an axiom. The first cases are
sumcheck, FRI, and Nova; a polynomial-commitment protocol, a preprocessing protocol, and one
lattice-backed protocol must follow before the common carrier is treated as mature. A construction
that does not naturally pass through ideal oracle reduction may enter at the committed-relation or
argument-system layer. The architecture must accommodate that route rather than force a false
encoding.

## 2. Architecture: pipeline plus two cross-cutting planes

The former “layer cake” was useful intuition but misleading as a dependency stack: security games
quantify over objects at several layers, and ideal reductions do not depend on adversarial worlds.
The end state has one object/compilation pipeline and two cross-cutting planes.

### 2.1 Object and compilation pipeline

```text
generic interaction syntax
        ↓ specialize to oracle protocols
ideal claims and oracle reductions (Δ)
        ↓ represent / lower / transport
committed relations and backend capabilities
        ↓ Fiat–Shamir / argument compiler
interactive or noninteractive argument systems
        ↓ executable refinement
production representations and implementations
```

- **PolyFun** supplies domain-agnostic interaction semantics: polynomial functors, `FreeM` and
  `ITree`, displayed data, handlers/responders, dynamical systems, finite and infinite runs,
  structural traces, generic sequential/multiparty/concurrent wiring, and refinement.
- **VCVio** specializes that substrate to oracle computation and probabilistic semantics:
  `OracleSpec`, `OracleComp`, `QueryImpl`, stateful simulation, evaluation distributions, random
  oracles, query resources, and cryptographic games.
- **ArkLib** supplies protocol meaning: prover/verifier roles, public and oracle messages, claims,
  relations, reductions, extractors, commitment-backend adapters, compilers, and concrete proof
  systems.

### 2.2 Adversarial-execution plane (Γ)

Worlds, persistent state, query-event traces, replay/reprogramming, probability, and resource
accounting interpret the pipeline's objects. PolyFun owns their effect-polymorphic structural
algebra; VCVio owns oracle/probability specializations; ArkLib owns the protocol games and security
notions that consume them. This plane is the subject of `03`, not a prerequisite for defining the
ideal carrier in `02`.

### 2.3 Mathematical and representation plane

`ArkLib/Data`, CompPoly, coding theory, finite fields, curves, modules, lattices, encodings, and
serialization cross several semantic layers. They are not “below” protocol syntax in a useful
sense. Each backend states exactly which mathematical structures and representation theorems it
uses.

## 3. The commonality claim, stated precisely

The target is **one capability-parametric language of ideal resources and claims**, not literal
identity of every hash-, curve-, and lattice-based construction.

- A FRI fold, a Nova fold, and a polynomial-evaluation reduction may all expose virtual output
  oracles, but their interfaces and guarantees differ.
- A backend advertises operations it can realize: random access, batch opening, evaluation,
  linear action on commitments, proximity enforcement, or a link argument.
- `GuaranteeTransport` says how an ideal slot guarantee becomes a commit/open/link obligation. It
  does not assert that every backend can realize every guarantee.
- A conformance theorem embeds a concrete construction into the common carrier and discharges its
  capability obligations. Failed conformance is evidence that the carrier needs a principled
  extension, not permission to add a scheme-local parallel framework.

Nova and FRI remain the canonical contrast. Pedersen linearity realizes a virtual linear action on
committed witnesses without a fresh prover message; Merkle commitments do not, so FRI requires a
fresh committed word plus consistency and proximity obligations. The shared abstraction is the
ideal transformation plus an explicit backend action—not a claim that the concrete protocols are
the same.

## 4. Security assumptions are complete game data

An assumption family is not merely “world + adversary class.” A usable computational game records:

1. the security parameter and public parameter/setup distribution;
2. the world and representation semantics in which the experiment runs;
3. the adversary interface and admissible class (including uniformity/advice choices);
4. the event or advantage functional;
5. the cost/resource model and reduction loss.

ROM, AGM, DLOG, SIS, and pairing assumptions instantiate different parts of this record. AGM, for
example, combines an instrumented algebraic-representation semantics with an adversary restriction;
it is not only a trace flag. VCVio owns generic game/reduction carriers and standalone primitive or
hardness games (for example Merkle, DLOG, or SIS); ArkLib owns protocol-security experiments that
consume them. AGM may therefore split into a VCVio algebraic world/representation adapter and an
ArkLib protocol adversary restriction.

## 5. Real objects and virtual views

The design deliberately tracks both layers.

- The **real layer** contains setup/input resources, prover messages, concrete data, world state,
  commitments, and openings.
- The **virtual layer** contains source-scoped query programs describing the oracle behavior a
  claim exposes.
- A runner-produced artifact relates them: security experiments consume the paired output of one
  execution. The current trace-free `CoreRun` is a public data carrier and permits pure normal forms.
  Its `closed` operation takes no replacement handler, but the record alone does not prove that its
  fields arose together. Executor equations, interpreted support, or runtime generation evidence
  establish provenance. Later private wrappers provide encapsulation, not distinct types for runs
  or an independent proof that an execution occurred.
- Compilation transforms real resources and transfers virtual guarantees into cryptographic
  obligations. It does not erase the distinction.

This is why `SourceCtx` remains an extensional handler presentation. `OracleModel` interprets
stable names and their promises; `NamedContext` selects distinct names, and its `View` expresses
aliasing. Keeping this information separate lets semantic substitution remain independent of
compiler metadata while retaining explicit provenance and guarantee obligations.

## 6. Refinement obligations at the executable boundary

`ExecutableMaterialization` is an attachment point, not the whole L6 story. A production refinement
theorem may need to relate:

- mathematical values to encoded/serialized representations;
- field, group, polynomial, or lattice operations to concrete arithmetic;
- abstract randomness and oracle calls to executable entropy sources and hash APIs;
- partiality, faults, and termination to the mathematical outcome model;
- executable memory/FFI traces to mathematical query and cost traces;
- measured or certified resource use to the stated budget model;
- constant-time or leakage behavior, when such a property is claimed.

Executable correctness therefore connects back to ideal and adversarial observations; it cannot be
proved wholly inside a detached materialization record.

## 7. What is fixed now, and what is evidence

Fixed design principles:

1. closed relations consume extensional oracle behavior;
2. virtual derivations are source-scoped and compose by handler substitution;
3. security games derive real/virtual closing from one runner-produced artifact rather than accepting split parts;
4. resource aliasing is explicit and disjoint union does not duplicate persistent resources;
5. security notions expose quantifier order, views, budgets, and losses;
6. compiler passes expose guarantee-transport and security-transfer obligations;
7. existing PolyFun/VCVio semantics are extended, not shadowed by ArkLib-private copies.

Still provisional until Lean clients elaborate:

- exact universes and field layouts of `OracleFamily`, `SourceCtx`, `ClaimWith`, and `CoreRun`;
- the final `NamedContext` and stable-name representation;
- compiler plan and backend capability field names;
- whether existing `TypeTree.Chain` is sufficient for n-ary reduction presentation.

The prototype `ArkLib/Interaction` tree on this design branch is valuable evidence and a lemma
bank. It is not proof that those APIs are current, stable, or mergeable wholesale.

## 8. Success criteria

The architecture has earned its abstraction when all of the following are true:

- sumcheck, FRI, Nova, one polynomial-commitment protocol, and one lattice-backed protocol use the
  same claim/closing discipline without scheme-local security frameworks;
- hash and homomorphic backends instantiate distinct capability sets and obtain transfer theorems
  with explicit losses;
- ordinary, state-restoration, and knowledge-soundness theorems compose only under their stated
  hypotheses, with exact resource/error accounting;
- an existing VCVio Merkle theorem is adapted into an ArkLib compiler capability without restating
  the primitive game;
- one executable implementation is related to its mathematical execution and resource trace;
- the three repositories remain acyclic and are released in a reproducible dependency train.

## 9. Non-goals for the first core

- A closed DSL of every derived oracle; `ofQuery` remains the escape hatch.
- One monolithic “secure protocol” structure; properties remain separate games plus bridges.
- Category-theory-first APIs or calling translations “functors” before categories and laws exist.
- A single execution-record type: structural branch/execution paths, verifier views, world query
  logs, and state-restoration move traces remain distinct with explicit conversions.
- Solving quantum-access or impossible-relativization cases inside the classical runner.
- Rebuilding generic UC machinery: PolyFun and VCVio already contain open-process and UC layers;
  the first oracle-reduction core merely does not depend on them.
