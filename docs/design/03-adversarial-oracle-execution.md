# 03 — Adversarial Oracle Execution: Worlds, Games, Extractors, Budgets

**Architecture and security requirements.** This chapter explains the persistent oracle-world
layer, denoted Γ, and the experiments in which protocol security is stated. It complements the
[claim-resource chapter](02-oracle-reduction-core.md), which describes deterministic read-only
resources Δ, closing, and native effect order. The reader is assumed to know provers, verifiers,
transcripts, and soundness. The probability contracts below distinguish existing results from
proposed world-backed theorems. [Current status](00-current-status.md) owns the theorem inventory;
the [roadmap](05-roadmap.md) owns implementation stages and dependencies.

## 1. Worlds

A world Γ is a VCVio `OracleRuntime`: a stateful query handler with an explicit initialization
computation. Initialization happens once, and all parties and phases use the same persistent state
in execution order. Δ resources are read-only and per-reduction; Γ is shared and never closed into
a claim. Source sums and disjoint unions of named contexts do not duplicate the world. A product
of state types does not establish independence: joint initialization and the underlying probability
semantics must justify any independence claim.

A random-oracle model uses a lazy-function world. An indexed family of logical oracles is one
joint world; independence and domain separation are properties to prove. An algebraic-group model
instead restricts the adversary class and instruments its trace, with basis ownership and extension
rules specified by each theorem. Relations which themselves query the model random oracle are
outside the present scope. Common theorems may use a trivial runtime; each theorem involving a
nontrivial world names its runtime family explicitly.

The existing VCVio `OracleRuntime.runFrom_bind` and `run_bind` laws sequence programs while
retaining final state and concatenating query logs. `resume` continues from a previous result
without repeating initialization. These laws supply ordinary world sequencing. A general
operational-machine prefix-concatenation API is needed only if a concrete client cannot use that
monadic route.

## 2. The execution artifact

An execution artifact keeps observations from one actual run together. It does not establish
that the run occurred merely by having the right fields. Supported experiments sample from the
runner's evaluation measure, and statements about particular results use executor equations or
`GeneratedBy`/support membership as provenance evidence.

The current layers are:

| Layer | Paired observations | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `CoreRun` | Concrete execution path, input behavior, private prover output, optional verifier claim | [`CoreRun.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/CoreRun.lean) |
| `LoggedRun` | Core run and verifier source-query answers in order | [`LoggedRun.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/LoggedRun.lean) |
| `TerminalRun` | Logged result with explicit accept, reject, or fault, and the same input behavior | [`TerminalRun.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/TerminalRun.lean) |
| `PhasedRun` | Input behavior, setup log, source observations, and world-query regions at concrete action boundaries | [`PhasedRun.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/PhasedRun.lean) |
| VCVio `RunResult` | Runner output, residual world state, and ordered surface-query log | `VCVio.OracleComp.Runtime` |

`executeStrategiesCore` executes ordinary prover and restricted verifier strategies directly.
`executeStrategiesLoggedRun` pairs that execution with its source log.
`executeStrategiesWithRuntime` runs the logged program in one initialized runtime; the direct
phased entry uses the existing phased interpreter. Erasure preserves the core result and actual
final state, and the phased/logged comparison preserves paired source observations and ordered
ambient history. These are execution equalities, not runtime soundness bounds.

Reduction entry points prepare the prover inside the same runtime and delegate to the shared
strategy runner. Setup may issue ambient queries, so moving it outside the runtime or initializing
again would change the experiment. The terminal adapters retain their existing outcome and erasure
contracts.

Closing uses the recorded input behavior and messages from the same concrete path. Source logs
record Δ queries; world logs record Γ surface queries. `LoggedRun.verifierLocalView` is derived
from the enclosing log, public path, and terminal output, without replay. Recovering local query
observations by replay would require an additional determinism theorem. A runtime surface log
also omits import queries performed by initialization or the handler, so it need not determine the
residual state.

An exported oracle query may execute several lower-level source queries. The proved
`withQueryLog_simulateQ` law records those actual handler programs and their query order. It does
not compare the logs by mapping each exported entry to one source entry. The runtime acceptance
client exercises this expansion alongside an ordinary native continuation and a shared counter.

Keep four views distinct: the concrete `ExecutionPath`, the `VerifierLocalView`, the world-query
log, and the proposed state-restoration move trace. A public path and verifier result omit local
query order and answers. Compiled extractors need the relevant world-query evidence; an ordinary
execution path does not substitute for it. `WorldTrace` should be a named view of the existing
surface `QueryLog`, with the needed routing evidence, rather than another trace carrier.

## 3. Outcomes and missing probability mass

The implemented terminal type separates three returned outcomes:

```lean
inductive Terminal (Claim Fault)
  | accept : Claim → Terminal Claim Fault
  | reject : Terminal Claim Fault
  | fault : Fault → Terminal Claim Fault
```

Acceptance carries a claim. Rejection is an ordinary returned result, and malformed parsing or
openings fail closed by rejecting. A fault reports model failure. Composition continues only
from acceptance and short-circuits on rejection or fault. Legacy protocols using `Option` or
`Bool` need a protocol-specific outcome decoder and correspondence theorem; `none` in the
optional-claim convention means rejection, never a returned fault.

Evaluation measures can also have missing mass, representing failure to return. This differs
from an explicit returned fault. [`Terminal.observe`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/TerminalMeasure.lean)
uses VCVio's failure-to-return boundary and requires the caller to name the fault assigned to
missing mass. Its proved laws preserve accepted and rejected mass exactly. The named fault
receives its original returned mass plus the missing mass; the observation has total mass one.
No decoder silently turns missing mass into rejection or acceptance.

A theorem counting only “accept and output a true claim” does not need to charge missing mass as
acceptance, and may require no losslessness hypothesis. Add a fault error when faults count as a
security failure or the theorem promises a separate fault bound. Such a claim states exactly
which returned faults and materialized failure-to-return events it covers. Extractor failure
belongs inside the knowledge-soundness bad event.

## 4. Games and ordinary soundness composition

Each security notion fixes sampling order, adversary phases, trace visibility, budget, observation,
and error/time parameters. An adaptive experiment samples its world before the adversary chooses
an instance; a static experiment fixes the instance first. The distinction changes the quantifiers
and must appear in the game definition.

Protocol games sequence the actual parties in one runtime. Preprocessing or an honest indexer
remains in that runtime between adversarial phases. A persistent state can be correlated with the
prover's memory and prior oracle answers; using the same oracle label in two stages does not
establish a common experiment.

### 4.1 Plain and restricted-oracle composition

For a false input, ordinary reduction soundness bounds the successful-output mass of a true output
claim. The proved plain native append theorem combines a prefix truth-transition bound `ε₁` with
a suffix bound `ε₂`, yielding `ε₁ + ε₂`. Its admissibility variant additionally charges `δ` for
intermediate outputs outside the suffix theorem's domain, yielding `ε₁ + δ + ε₂`. The suffix
premise covers every false, admissible prefix result, including unreachable ones, and every
native suffix strategy. The execution equation needs only a lawful monad; its probability theorem
needs lawful distribution semantics. It does not assume independent stages, uniform challenges,
finite message sets, or lossless execution.

The restricted-oracle theorem in `Oracle/CompositionSoundness` identifies the actual intermediate
closed claim and routes suffix queries through its exported interface. Its prefix is one ordinary
whole prover's actual prefix, including the continuation it returns. The theorem requires suffix
security only almost everywhere at false admissible boundary claims, and it charges false
inadmissible claims separately from true claims. The final event observes a returned claim after
the verifier's final action and closing with the actual execution resources.

This result uses total deterministic source handlers and lawful probability semantics for the
ambient oracle computation. Section 4.3 gives the separate persistent-runtime theorem and its
actual-distribution premise. Existing phase logs and profile-additivity laws alone do not establish
that security premise.

### 4.2 Probability premises at the actual boundary

There is no single weakest assumption without fixing the experiment, its success event, and the
boundary observation. For a fixed execution, the relevant quantity is success of its actual
remaining computation, averaged over boundary results the prefix produces. A reusable uniform
bound is convenient, but stronger than necessary.

Let `μ` be the prefix's successful-output measure on complete boundary results. A boundary retains
whatever determines continuation: the intermediate claim, the actual prover continuation including
private memory, verifier-local values, and relevant history. For a world-backed experiment it also
retains the actual residual world state, jointly distributed with those values. This description
is for the proof and does not grant the prover access to hidden fields.

Let `E` be the prefix event charged as an error: a true intermediate claim reached from a false
input, or an accepted claim outside the suffix's admissibility assumptions. If the actual suffix
success probability after boundary `b` is bounded by `e(b)` outside `E`, the
weighted bound is

```text
Pr[final success] ≤ μ(E) + ∫ over boundaries outside E, e(b) dμ(b).
```

This bound is proved for plain native append. It also allows a final action after the whole
interaction: the suffix premise includes that action, and the final event observes its result.
For example, if the verifier makes one last random query and may reject, those effects and that
rejection belong inside the probability being bounded. The action runs after the prover's last
response. No assumption allows moving it earlier.

The reusable probability argument is a specialization of VCVio's existing weighted bound for
sequential computations. It retains missing mass, and the local bound only needs to hold almost
everywhere. The error function itself does not need a separate measurability assumption.
The restricted-oracle theorem applies this bound to the actual exported-interface execution.
A persistent-world application still needs its joint state and interpretation bridges.

The suffix measure or kernel must describe the actual remaining execution. Its definition needs
an order-preserving sequential decomposition and appropriate lawful measure semantics. Obtaining
it from a coarser observation may need conditional-probability infrastructure; it cannot be
assumed to exist solely because a public transcript is available. Missing prefix mass contributes
no boundary output to `μ`.

Useful sufficient forms of this premise, from easiest to reuse to most specific to an experiment,
are:

- A uniform bound for every false admissible boundary and every allowed continuation.
- A bound restricted to boundaries in the chosen prefix program's support.
- A bound holding almost everywhere under its actual output measure, allowing a probability-zero
  exceptional set.
- A variable suffix bound integrated over the actual boundary distribution, or a direct bound on
  that average when no useful pointwise bound exists.

Support reachability means structural possibility under the chosen program, including the returned
strategy. It is not necessarily positive probability: a supported result may have measure zero.
Almost-everywhere premises and integrals require the relevant measurability facts. Uniform bounds
are corollaries of the broader target, and there is no requirement to prove security at unreachable
boundaries for one fixed execution. The plain native layer provides these fixed-prover, support,
almost-everywhere, and weighted forms. Restricted oracle composition provides the
almost-everywhere weighted bound and its uniform corollary. `Oracle/RuntimeSoundness` extends
the execution split to one persistent runtime, under the averaged suffix premise below.

### 4.3 Hidden state and adversary information

`executeStrategiesWithRuntime_appendExported_soundness` bounds the probability that the actual
native execution returns a closed claim satisfying the final relation. It fixes the whole prover
before runtime setup and splits execution at the prover's actual continuation. The split retains
the runtime state and ordered ambient history from that run.

Write `μ` for the joint distribution after the prefix and `E` for an exceptional event at that
point. For each result `b`, resume the actual suffix with the saved state and let `s(b)` be its
success probability. The theorem assumes the average bound

```text
∫ outside E, s(b) dμ(b) ≤ ∫ outside E, error(b) dμ(b)
```

and concludes `Pr[final relation holds] ≤ Pr[E] + ∫ outside E, error(b) dμ(b)`.
The client chooses `E` and proves this premise for its runtime. For example, `E` can include a true
intermediate claim or a false claim outside the suffix theorem's assumptions. The integral uses the
actual probability mass, without conditioning on acceptance or renormalizing missing mass.

The suffix receives the prefix output, including its native prover continuation. Runtime resumption
supplies hidden state internally. The mathematical premise may inspect that state; it does not give
the prover permission to read it. Replacing the actual suffix by one with a fresh hidden state would
lose its correlation with prover memory and would not meet the theorem's premise.

For example, suppose the world samples a hidden uniform bit and a prover which has learned nothing
about it always guesses zero. Its average success is one-half. Conditional on the secret being
zero, its success is one, so a one-half bound for every fixed secret is false. The correct averaged
premise remains useful. Conversely, if the prefix reveals the bit, the same fresh-world guessing
bound cannot be applied to the actual suffix: its prover now has that information and can succeed
with probability one.

Pointwise suffix bounds for every reachable hidden state are a sufficient special case when a
protocol proves them. The main theorem averages over the actual correlated experiment. A concrete client must still
show which queries the prover can issue and what their answers reveal. The
boundary may expose hidden state to mathematical analysis without exposing it to the adversary.

### 4.4 Common first scope and error accounting

The first world-backed oracle target uses finite classical interaction trees, deterministic
read-only Δ resources, no terminal-view Γ queries, explicit challenge computations, fail-closed
parsing, and an order-preserving sequential decomposition. These are sufficient initial conditions,
not necessary restrictions on all future composition theorems. Read-only Δ terminal queries can
become ordinary values after interpretation; their observable logs must still be preserved. Broader
effectful boundaries follow the scheduling requirements in
[the claim-resource chapter](02-oracle-reduction-core.md#53-effect-order-and-terminal-computation).

The proposed common-case security contract combines prefix soundness `ε₁`, the probability `δ` of
a false intermediate claim outside the suffix's input assumptions, and suffix soundness under the
actual remaining distribution. True intermediate claims are already charged by `ε₁`; `δ` need not
charge them again. Splitting successful runs into true, false admissible, and false inadmissible
intermediate claims yields the target
`ε₁ + δ + sup ε₂`; retaining variable suffix errors gives the integral above. Add `ε_fault` when
the exported bad event or fault guarantee requires it. The runtime theorem proves the execution and averaging step. It does not establish these
protocol-specific error bounds automatically: clients must prove them for the actual prefix and
suffix, including any access restrictions or runtime invariants they rely on.

### 4.5 Access and query budgets

The route-access and cost theorems in `Data/OracleComp/QueryBounds` apply to the same `simulateQ`
program. Access checks every query in the authored program and in each allowed query's route.
Canonical prefix names connect source tags to the input queries and oracle sends already available.
A resource name assigned by an arbitrary classifier is not evidence of access. The two-send client
uses the actual phased run's join and terminal prefixes for its source-resource certificates and
connects its source log through the phased/logged equality. `WorldPhase.queries` remains the ambient
query log; it is not identified with the source-capability log. A general arbitrary-classifier
profile still needs an independent proof connecting those labels to actual resources.

The weighted cost theorem bounds every complete execution allowed by the query types. If an
exported query has charge `c`, its routing program must have source cost at most `c`. The routed
program then inherits the exported program's budget. Repeated calls count repeatedly even when
they name the same received oracle. The bind theorem adds prefix and suffix budgets without a
probability or independence assumption.

These cost bounds use complete execution paths. If a query has no possible answer, there may be no
complete path to bound. The separate access predicate still checks that query, so it can reject an
unavailable resource even when a complete-path cost bound is vacuous. The pinned cost API uses
small query and response types; the structural naming laws retain the prefix API's universes.

`RuntimeQueryBounds` reuses C7's exact guessing prover and experiment. Its conjunction proves
actual export provenance, source and routed-suffix certificates, the complete runtime's imported
query budget, the actual ambient history charge, and the same half-bound theorem. The imported
query count and the weighted ambient/source charges use separate cost models. The informed prover
retains its real query history and success one; these resource facts do not supply its missing
half-error premise.

## 5. State restoration

State restoration is a separate proposed security layer for compiled protocols. It is not a
checkpoint/restore operation: the adversary may submit multiple purported prefixes, with consistent
answers on repeated moves, and the final output re-derives every challenge. The intended salted move
shape is schematic:

```lean
structure SRMove (Π : PublicCoinIOP) where
  round : Fin Π.rounds
  inst  : Π.Instance
  prfx  : Π.ProofPrefix round
  salts : Π.SaltPrefix round

-- One random function per round, keyed on the entire move.
-- The prover has a move budget B; the trace records moves and responses.
```

The target notions include ordinary, straightline knowledge, and rewinding knowledge soundness,
with explicit error and running-time dependence on the experiment and budget. Straightline
extractors receive the state-restoration trace; rewinding extractors additionally receive the named
black-box access. Bridges from round-by-round security, special soundness, and to Fiat–Shamir must
state their entropy, salt, replay, budget, and loss assumptions. The planned round-by-round bridge
includes the `(B+r)` loss; it is not supplied by native ordinary composition.

Cost transport reuses VCVio's `ReductionWithCost`. Additive or substitution-style advantage error
needs the supported error-bearing reduction extension described in the
[foundation chapter](01-foundations.md). The causal trace and conditioning interfaces needed by
these proofs are separate upstream gaps.

## 6. Extractors and knowledge composition

Knowledge soundness requires witness availability, not only a bound on true output claims.
An offline extractor of a final execution path may learn a middle witness too late to supply it
to the second protocol. Terminal offline knowledge soundness therefore does not compose in general.
Valid targets require a prefix-measurable middle extractor, auxiliary-input-robust first-stage
knowledge soundness, or grafting of a suitable round-by-round transcript extractor. Any implication
from knowledge soundness to ordinary soundness also needs the causally available witness supplier
used by its game, rather than a bare existential witness.

Extractor interfaces specify adversary access, execution control, oracle evidence, output shape,
algorithm class, and world model. In particular, an offline concrete execution-path extractor and
an offline world-log extractor are different capabilities. Substituting the former for the latter
would omit the oracle-query evidence needed by compiled Merkle extraction. Further targets include
query-only and black-box interfaces for one pass, prefix queries, and checkpoint/restore, plus
witness transport and special-soundness or round-by-round transcript trees.

Compiled-layer extraction is planned as a causal pipeline:

```text
segment at Fiat–Shamir events
  → stateful multi-configuration Merkle extraction
  → hash-chain backtracking
  → state-restoration trace adaptation
  → inner state-restoration extractor
```

Each step needs order, causality, resource, error, and time evidence. The generic finite-trace
transducer and causality algebra belong in PolyFun; VCVio specializes them to query logs with
external resource certificates. ArkLib supplies protocol adapters, extractor composition, black-box
transport, and error/time substitution. Stateful online Merkle extraction remains a backend
capability consuming the shared runtime artifacts; it is not replaced by a pure list pass. These
are target interfaces and dependencies, not consequences of the ordinary composition theorem.

## 7. Round-by-round trees and implication targets

The planned constrained execution tree uses PolyFun cursors and restricted decorations. It
records shared prover prefixes, verifier forks with explicit conditional challenge computations,
pairwise-distinct sibling challenges where required, world-history agreement, and stable resource
identities. It can be bridged to operational-machine prefixes without identifying the carriers.

Round-by-round state is indexed by full concrete prefixes; public projection is a separate view.
Available sources grow under prefix extension, and no prefix receives future resources. Both
Chiesa-Yogev-compatible whole-message notions and WARP/ABF-style local witness-transport notions
are intended to coexist, alongside their explicit native generalizations. They differ in access,
timing, terminal laws and efficiency; no unconditional ordering is assumed. The
[literature crosswalk](../kb/audits/interaction-literature-map.md) records these distinctions,
including FICS/FACS tree extraction and VCVio's BGTZ interface. The roadmap's implication
proofs must state which notion they use and
which replay, entropy, and budget hypotheses support the `(B+r)` losses. Legacy formulations or
archived proofs do not establish the corresponding native world-backed theorems. A reversible
strong claim-tree interface must remain distinguishable from the relaxed probabilistic endpoint.

## 8. Budgets, errors, and time

Resource accounting reuses VCVio's `ResourceProfile`, query-bound, cost-model, and reduction
interfaces. ArkLib adds protocol-specific names and feasibility conditions, schematically:

```text
ProtocolResource := oracleQuery(id) | srMove | commitment | configuration | opening
ProtocolBudget := ResourceProfile refined by feasibility predicates
ε, T : ProtocolBudget → Params → FailureRate → RuntimeBound → ℝ≥0∞
```

The existing phase profiles count world queries under a supplied fixed classification. The planned
certification bridge must show that each classified query refers to a resource available at that
phase, preserves identity and aliasing, charges virtual-query expansion, and meets the stated
prefix/suffix budgets. Arithmetic additivity alone establishes none of these facts. A context's
disjoint names do not imply independent world state or fresh copies of shared resources.

Failure probability is experiment-specific. No parallel ledger or universal adversary-characteristics
record is introduced. Budget transport accompanies every reduction or transducer, including claims
such as a state-restoration prover making at most the Fiat–Shamir query budget's number of moves.
Error composition can be additive or substitution-style. Concrete expected-time recurrences remain
ArkLib theorems until multiple clients justify a generic upstream interface; reduction time stays
explicit.

## 9. Deferred obligations

- Zero knowledge and witness indistinguishability need programmable worlds, query-before-program
  events, local-view Merkle simulators, per-leaf and Fiat–Shamir salts, and paired experiments.
- Indifferentiability replaces an oracle distribution through a simulator, trace translator, and
  view-equivalence theorem. It is a cryptographic reduction, rather than compiler lowering.
- Quantum access requires a separate linear execution model and lies outside this classical core.

State restoration and compiler security require causal query evidence, extraction, resource bounds,
and guarantee transport beyond ordinary composition. FRI and Spartan ports and their two-way
legacy correspondences are separate clients; they are not prerequisites for establishing the
composition API against Sumcheck.
