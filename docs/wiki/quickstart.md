# Quickstart

This page is the recommended agent playbook for commands and validation.
Use it as the main guide for routine local checks.

## Recommended Validation

For a convenient routine check, run:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

On a cold clone, fetch precompiled dependencies first:

```bash
lake exe cache get
./scripts/validate.sh
```

## Validation By Change Type

### Existing Lean files only

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

### Added, renamed, or deleted files under `ArkLib/`

```bash
git add path/to/newfile.lean
./scripts/validate.sh
```

`./scripts/update-lib.sh` only considers tracked files, and fails fast if untracked
`ArkLib/**/*.lean` files are present.

### Compile-time acceptance tests

Place examples and regression tests under `ArkLibTest/`, mirroring the production module path.
Run `lake test` to build them; `./scripts/validate.sh` runs this target by default and rejects all
test warnings, including admissions. Stage new tests so source linting and the trust inventory
include them. Production modules must not import tests.

### Maintained concrete examples

Place durable, concrete applications under `ArkLibExamples/` and add them to the hand-maintained
`ArkLibExamples.lean` umbrella. The examples library builds with the default `lake build`, and
`./scripts/validate.sh` rejects all of its warnings, including admissions. Examples may import
stable `ArkLib` owner modules; `ArkLib` must not import `ArkLibExamples`.

The Reed–Solomon examples currently check exact arithmetic for ProveKit, ZisK, and LambdaVM:
query budgets, supplied algebraic-count expressions, and specified payload models. They do not
yet derive those supplied counts from the coding theorems. The generic
`HiddenDerivative/Interpolation/FirstOrder` modules establish a capped support and a nonzero
interpolant satisfying the actual local constraints under a dimension surplus. Completing the
application bridge requires the sharper cutoff-sensitive rank formula, its finite support count,
and the symbolic-height and geometric exceptional-count bounds. Keep these mathematical
obligations distinct from numerical evaluation; a checked integer constant alone is not a
verified bound on a bad event.

### Lean source-policy checks

```bash
lake exe lint-style
```

`./scripts/validate.sh` runs this gate by default. The Lean executable scans every module imported
by `ArkLib.lean` or `ArkLibExamples.lean` and every tracked `ArkLibTest` module, parses import
headers with Lean itself, and has no exception file. It allows
project-specific mathematical Unicode notation, while rejecting invisible controls, bidirectional
controls, and nonstandard space characters that can conceal source changes. It also rejects
blanket package-root imports. The normal `lake build` loads ArkLib's Lean syntax-tree plugin, which
rejects source-level linter suppressions in their actual parsed context.

If the task is specifically Lean warning cleanup, follow
[`../skills/fix-lean-warnings.md`](../skills/fix-lean-warnings.md).

### Filling a `sorry`, or work that must stay axiom-clean

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --axioms
```

This first runs `./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh` — the executable fixture matrix under
`scripts/AxiomSweepTestFixtures/` that certifies the sweep tool itself (gate directions,
the native-trust floor, and the exit-code contract) — and then
`lake exe axiomsweep --check`: a kernel-level sweep of every `ArkLib.*` and `ArkLibExamples.*`
declaration's axiom dependencies (the `#print axioms` information, library-wide) diffed
against the committed baseline `scripts/axiom_baseline.json`. It fails on *new* `sorryAx`
or non-standard-axiom taint, while reporting closed gaps without blocking cleanup. If you
intentionally add a tagged `sorry` (or close one), refresh and commit the reviewed baseline
diff:

```bash
lake exe axiomsweep --update-baseline
```

The baseline is an allowlist for `sorryAx` debt only. Native-compiler trust
(`Lean.ofReduceBool`, `Lean.trustCompiler`, and the per-declaration
`…._native.<tactic>.ax_<n>_<n>` axioms that `native_decide`-style tactics mint) is held to
a zero-debt rule: no baseline edit can green it, and `--update-baseline` refuses to write
while such taint is present — remove the dependency instead.

CI enforces both the fixture matrix and the library regression check (see `ci.yml`).
It also runs `scripts/source-trust-audit.py` over every tracked Lean file under `ArkLib/`,
`ArkLibExamples/`, and `ArkLibTest/`.
That deterministic, comment/string-aware inventory reports source-only constructs that an
environment sweep cannot see reliably: admissions in examples or defaults/autoparams and
constructs in files outside the imported roots. Source inventory changes are review evidence,
not a global `sorry` ban; the kernel sweep remains the taint verdict.

### Docstrings, blueprint, or website changes

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --docs
```

For website or blueprint output, run:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --site
```

`./scripts/build-web.sh` assembles the site, and skips blueprint generation if `leanblueprint`
is not installed. If blueprint output matters, install it first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install leanblueprint
```

## Important Notes

- `./scripts/validate.sh` is the recommended convenience wrapper for routine local validation.
- By default it runs `lake build`, rejects non-`sorry` warnings anywhere under `ArkLib/`, rejects
  every warning under `ArkLibExamples/`, runs the
  Lean-native source-policy gate, runs the compiled `toyproblem-runtime` and `hachi-runtime`
  checks, checks generated imports and documentation integrity, and lints knowledge-base inputs.
- The lower-level scripts remain valid when you only want one specific check.
- `docs/kb/_generated/**` freshness is handled by generated-files PRs from the main-branch KB
  workflow, not by ordinary PR validation.
- `scripts/build-project.sh` is a compile-only helper, not the convenience wrapper.
- `scripts/README.md` is the inventory of helper scripts.
- Only run docs and site builds when those surfaces are relevant; they are slower and more
  tool-dependent than normal Lean builds.
- `--lint` remains a deprecated compatibility flag; style linting is always enforced.

## Checking axiom hygiene correctly

ArkLib's axiom-clean baseline is exactly `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (see
[`../skills/prove-milestone.md`](../skills/prove-milestone.md) invariant 6). Two traps make a
naive check report success on something that should fail:

- **`#print axioms` is only meaningful for declarations that elaborated cleanly.**
  (`Lean.collectAxioms` does traverse both the type and the value, so a `sorry`-patched
  statement *does* report `sorryAx` — but a declaration that failed to elaborate outright may
  not exist to probe at all, and probing a *different*, successfully-elaborated declaration
  proves nothing about the broken one.) Check the file compiles with zero errors first; a
  belt-and-braces `(← getConstInfo n).type.hasSorry = false` assertion is cheap in sweep
  metaprograms. A silent `#print axioms` result on its own is not evidence the intended
  statement was proved.
- **A metaprogram sweep over the environment silently skips private declarations**, whose internal
  names are mangled. De-mangle with `Lean.privateToUserName?` before filtering by module, or the
  sweep will quietly under-report.

When reporting results, prefer "axiom-clean against the baseline" over "axiom-free", and state the
counting basis (public / source-level / all-non-internal) — declaration totals are not comparable
across differently-written probes, whereas the set of `sorryAx` carriers is.

## Compiled execution checks

Some things a theorem cannot state — that a definition compiles to code at all, and that running
it gives the expected answer — are checked by compiled executables under `scripts/`, declared as
`lean_exe` targets in `lakefile.toml` and run by `validate.sh`:

| target | file | what it certifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `toyproblem-runtime` | `scripts/ToyProblemRuntime.lean` | the toy-problem launch cone |
| `hachi-runtime` | `scripts/HachiRuntime.lean` | the nonrecursive Hachi honest-prover path |

**Put them here, not under `ArkLib/`.** A file under `ArkLib/` is picked up by the generated
library root, so a `#eval` in one is paid on every build by everyone; and `#eval` runs in the
interpreter, which is far slower than compiled code. The pattern each file follows is a
`check : String → Bool → IO Unit` that throws on failure, a `run : IO Unit` listing the checks,
and `def main := run`.

Two things to get right when adding one:

- **Make each check lazy** — `def myCheck : Unit → Bool := fun _ => …`, not `def myCheck : Bool`.
  Top-level values of non-function type are evaluated at *module initialization*, so an eager
  check runs before `main` does. A slow one then hangs the executable before it can print
  anything, and per-check timings all read zero because the work already happened.
- **Keep the gated checks fast, and put slow ones behind a flag.** `hachi-runtime` gates on its
  millisecond checks and hides its composed protocol run behind `--full` (that run passes, but
  takes about six minutes — the honest sumcheck prover dominates), with `--timing` for per-check
  costs.

## Optional Direct Commands

You can still run the underlying pieces directly when debugging a specific issue:

```bash
lake build
lake exe toyproblem-runtime
lake exe hachi-runtime
./scripts/check-imports.sh
python3 ./scripts/check-docs-integrity.py
python3 ./scripts/kb/lint.py
./scripts/test-axiomsweep.sh
lake exe axiomsweep --check
```

If you specifically need to regenerate `ArkLib.lean`, use:

```bash
./scripts/update-lib.sh
```

If blueprint output matters and `leanblueprint` is missing:

```bash
python3 -m pip install leanblueprint
```

## CI Mapping

- [`../../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  runs the timing-enabled main build on PRs and pushes to `main`, measures a
  clean build, a warm rebuild, and the `./scripts/validate.sh` path, runs the
  source trust inventory plus axiom-sweep fixture matrix and library regression baseline
  (all axiom verdicts enforcing), and reuses that build for blueprint/declaration
  validation and API-documentation generation. The PR-head job has read-only contents
  permission; on pushes, a separate job deploys its generated static-site artifact with
  Pages/OIDC permission. It uploads timing artifacts consumed by the trusted
  [`../../.github/workflows/build-timing-report.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build-timing-report.yml)
  workflow, which computes the baseline comparison and posts the PR report.
- [`../../.github/workflows/check-imports.yml`](../../.github/workflows/check-imports.yml)
  checks that `ArkLib.lean` matches the tracked source tree.
- [`../../.github/workflows/docs-integrity.yml`](../../.github/workflows/docs-integrity.yml)
  checks local markdown links and the `CLAUDE.md` symlink.
- [`../../.github/workflows/kb-generated.yml`](../../.github/workflows/kb-generated.yml)
  opens generated-files PRs for KB indexes and missing cited-paper stubs after pushes to `main`.

Pull requests enter GitHub's merge queue after their normal review and required checks pass. The
queue creates a temporary integration ref containing the queued changes on current `main`; the CI,
import, and docs-integrity workflows run again on that `merge_group` ref before GitHub may merge it.
The CI validation path includes the Lean-native source-policy gate. PR-only timing comparisons and
comments remain attached to the ordinary PR run and are intentionally skipped for merge groups,
which do not carry a pull-request payload.

## Manual Timing Helper

If you need to reproduce the timing workflow locally, the same helper script can
capture a measurement and render a report:

```bash
bash scripts/build_timing_report.sh run clean_build /tmp/build-timing.jsonl -- \
  bash -eo pipefail -c 'rm -rf .lake/build && lake build'
bash scripts/build_timing_report.sh run warm_rebuild /tmp/build-timing.jsonl -- \
  bash -eo pipefail -c 'lake build'
bash scripts/build_timing_report.sh run native_build /tmp/build-timing.jsonl -- \
  bash -eo pipefail -c 'lake build toyproblem-runtime hachi-runtime lint-style'
bash scripts/build_timing_report.sh run test_path /tmp/build-timing.jsonl -- \
  bash -eo pipefail -c './scripts/validate.sh'
bash scripts/build_timing_report.sh render /tmp/build-timing.jsonl
```

Read the rows in that order, because they share one tree and each leaves it warmer:

- `clean_build` and `warm_rebuild` bracket the incremental-build signal.
- `native_build` carries the `.c.o` chain that the compiled executables link — currently
  `toyproblem-runtime`, `hachi-runtime`, and `lint-style`. It is the row that swings on `.lake`
  cache state, so a dependency bump shows its cost here. **Adding a compiled executable to
  `validate.sh` means
  adding it to this command too**, or its link cost lands in `test_path` instead.
- `test_path` is therefore the cost of the validation gate itself on an already-built project,
  not of a cold `./scripts/validate.sh`. CI passes no flags, so `--docs`, `--site` and
  `--axioms` never appear in it.

A row whose measurement could not be taken renders as `measurement failed`, not as a missing row.
Per-target times are printed with the precision Lake reported (`22`, `3.5`, `0.770`); Lake emits
whole seconds above 10s, so those figures are not accurate to two decimals.

For PRs, the trusted reporter compares only with a successful timing artifact whose push SHA is
the PR's exact measured base. If that artifact is unavailable or expired, the report says so and
shows current measurements without inventing a substitute baseline. A previous PR update answers a
different question and is therefore not used as the regression baseline.

Timing artifacts include the PR head, actual measured checkout (normally GitHub's synthetic PR
merge commit), exact base, dependency-manifest hash, exact/fallback cache state, and runner
image/version. Reports show both wall time and CPU work (`user + sys`). Movement in both suggests
changed compilation work or runner speed; wall-only movement more often indicates scheduling or I/O
contention. These diagnostics improve attribution, but one hosted-runner sample is still not a
performance verdict. Per-file rows are leads to remeasure, not blocking regression claims.
