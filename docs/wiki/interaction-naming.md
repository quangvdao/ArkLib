# Typed interaction names

The typed interaction API names describe the mathematical data and its interpretation. The source
layer lives in [`Source.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/Source.lean); named contexts and their
models live in [`Resource.lean`](../../ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/Resource.lean).

## Sources and their morphisms

`SourceCtx Query Env` is a reader-valued `OracleContext`. It specifies a response type for each
query and interprets each environment as a deterministic handler. Fixing an environment forgets
its representation and exposes its answers. Different environments may yield the same handler.

A `SourceHom S T` sends queries forward, pulls responses back through a polynomial lens, and pulls
environments back through `pullEnv : T.Env → S.Env` (schematically; the carriers are parameters).
Its commuting equation says that routing a query gives the same answer as interpreting it in the
pulled environment. `SourceEquiv` additionally provides inverse morphisms, including inverse
environment maps; equality of observable answers alone does not establish it.

| Operation | Queries | Responses | Environments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `S.sum T` | Either an `S` query or a `T` query | Response of the selected source | A pair |
| `S.tensor T` | A pair of queries | A pair of responses | A pair |
| `SourceCtx.sigma S` | An index and a query of that component | Response of that component | A dependent family |

`sum` is signature addition. `tensor` uses `PFunctor.tensor`: the polynomial tensor, whose response
directions form a product. It differs from the categorical product of polynomials, whose response
directions form a sum. `sigma` is indexed signature addition. These operations describe query
interfaces, without imposing disjointness of oracle names or a scheduling interpretation.

`SourceHom.sigmaMap` maps indexed sources componentwise; `sigmaInj` includes one component.
`SourceHom.congrFamily` retains its name because it transports within a family along an equality
of indices. For morphisms, `g.comp f` means first `f`, then `g`.

## Names, models, and views

`OracleModel` interprets a family indexed by stable names. It assigns source interpretations,
admissible `Realization` types, owner and origin metadata, and a language of `PropertySymbol`s.
`satisfies` interprets each property symbol as a predicate on realizations. `promised` selects the
symbols whose predicates hold for every admissible realization, as certified by
`satisfies_promises`. A `Guarantee` is a selected symbol together with evidence that it is promised.
These are ideal promises; cryptographic enforcement remains a separate compilation obligation.

`NamedContext` represents a subcontext through `name : Index ↪ Id`. It names distinct entries;
it neither stores their realizations nor allocates them. A `NamedContext.Inclusion S T` preserves
each name. Injectivity of the naming maps makes such an inclusion unique when it exists, even
though the two contexts may use different index types.

`NamedContext.View S` is an arbitrary indexed family of references into `S`, given by `toIndex`.
A view may omit entries or reference an entry repeatedly. Its interpreted source uses the original
context's realization family, so aliases observe the same realization. `share` combines views of
one context. `disjointUnion` combines contexts, or views over contexts, only with evidence that the
underlying names do not overlap. `disjointUnionSourceEquiv` relates this construction to `sum` of
the interpreted sources.

## Virtual interfaces and substitution

`OracleFamily` is an indexed family of realization types with explicit `interface` data. Its
`behaviorOfRealizations` interprets those values as answers; its `asBehaviorSource` instead admits
all deterministic handlers, including ones no realization represents. Neither injectivity nor
surjectivity of the interpretation is assumed. Reindexing a family copies interface types and
allows independently supplied values at repeated indices. It does not create a shared-realization
view.

`VirtualOracle srcSpec Out` supplies a program over `srcSpec` for every output query. Its `eval`
returns output behavior, without constructing output realizations. `substSource` replaces each
source query with a program over another signature. `mapSource` specializes this to a coherent
`SourceHom`; `sumWeaken` includes the source signature in a larger sum. `a.subst b` substitutes
`a`'s programs into the downstream oracle `b`; `substWithSuffix` also retains a separate suffix
signature for downstream queries. These operations use VCVio's existing interpreter.

`SemEquiv` compares answers under every deterministic source handler. It does not assert equal
query traces, equal cost, or equivalence under stateful handlers. In particular, an unused repeated
query can change a trace without changing deterministic answers. This semantic relation is the
one used for the exported identity and associativity laws.

## Claims and relations

`ClaimWith` pairs a public statement with an explicit representation of its oracle component.
`OpenClaim` carries query programs awaiting a handler; `ClosedClaim` carries observable behavior;
`ConcreteClaim` carries realizations interpreted by the declared interfaces. Closing an open claim
uses `closeWith`; interpreting a concrete claim uses `toClosed`. Neither operation checks relation
membership or proves that its inputs came from a protocol execution.

`ConcreteClaim.closesTo` says exactly that `toClosed` equals the specified closed claim. Hidden
representation tags and different programs can disappear under interpretation. In particular,
concrete realizations need not be honest, and an open claim need not be accepted.

`ClaimFamily` is a dependent family of claim types over a public context. `closedOracle` specializes
it to closed oracle claims. `Problem` adds claim-dependent witnesses, admissibility, and a relation
that entails admissibility. `language` existentially quantifies the witness. `Relation` removes the
admissibility restriction; it does not assert that every claim has a witness.

## Execution data and closing

`CoreRun` stores a concrete path, initial behavior, private output, and the terminal open claim.
`executeCore` packages these from the existing executor. The public carrier also admits algebraic
normal forms; an executor equation, interpreted support, or a runtime generation witness supplies
provenance when a theorem needs it. Constructor visibility is an API discipline, not that witness.

`TerminalClaim` is the optional-claim convention at a completed branch: `some` carries a claim and
`none` denotes verifier rejection. It does not represent failure of the ambient computation to
return. `CoreRun.closed` interprets only with its stored input behavior and path messages, accepting
no separate handler. `closed_eq_concrete_iff` characterizes agreement with a concrete claim by
statement and observable-answer equality, without asserting honesty or relation membership.

## Ordered execution interfaces

`ExecutionInterface` names a stage boundary by its public statement type, exported oracle
`Index` and `Realization` types, `oracles`, and separate private state. A `ClosedStage` selects its
protocol and reduction from the current public statement, derives its witness from the private
state, and computes the next private state from the actual execution path and accepted output.
`OrderedExecution` runs these stages in order and stops on rejection.

The invariant theorems require preservation at every stage. Their probabilistic forms require
almost-sure acceptance and invariant preservation; the measure bridge additionally assumes the
stated discrete response spaces and agreement between the query measures and their probability
mass functions. These interfaces and theorems do not by themselves assert execution provenance,
noninterference of values captured when constructing a stage, or a security composition theorem.

`TypeTree.sourceAfter` is one source context for the final accumulated access signature. Its
environment contains the initial handler and the messages along that branch. It does not choose
messages for unvisited branches or assert that arbitrary structural paths are inhabited.

## Sumcheck oracle roles

The single-round verifier checks the sent polynomial and evaluates it for the next target. Its
`outputOracle` instead retains the input oracle. This distinction allows a dishonest message to
pass the local sum check while the closed output relation fails; it is essential for soundness.
`degreeModel` interprets the degree guarantee already carried by the refined message type, and
`honestClaim` gives the corresponding concrete claim. `projectionOracle` answers univariate round
queries by the existing multivariate projection program.

`honestRun` is an algebraic normal form; `executeCore_honest` proves the actual executor returns it
under the input sum premise. Sampled perfect completeness additionally requires a lossless
challenge program. These completeness theorems do not establish adversarial soundness.

In the one-round soundness API, `committedRun` is the normal form for a message fixed before the
challenge. `executeCommitted_eq` relates it to actual execution. Here commitment means choosing
the message first, not using a cryptographic commitment scheme. `executeCommitted_soundness`
bounds accepted true outputs for a false input sum under a fresh uniform finite-field challenge;
`executeRandomCommitment_soundness` also permits randomized, possibly failing message selection
before that challenge. Neither theorem states multi-round or knowledge soundness.

`legacy_input_iff` and `legacy_output_iff` give both directions of relation correspondence for
arbitrary concrete claims. `legacy_honest_verifier_correspondence` is narrower: it compares honest
executions. The legacy verifier reads the input polynomial for its next target, while the typed
verifier reads the sent polynomial. Their arbitrary-message executions are not identified.

## Consecutive multivariate rounds

`MultivariateRound.polynomialFamily` declares the persistent multivariate evaluation interface.
Its `outputOracle` retains the supplied input behavior, while each round's newly sent univariate
polynomial supplies the sum check and next target. The two-round executor passes the first actual
closed claim to the second and skips the second after rejection. Sampled equations preserve the
first-then-second challenge order. Completeness transports the multivariate relation through both
rounds; it does not compose the one-round soundness error.

## Arbitrary multivariate rounds

`MultivariateRound.roundStages` packages any finite interval of multivariate Sumcheck rounds as an
`OrderedExecution`. Each challenge program receives the current public round statement; the
accepted closed claim, including its oracle behavior, becomes the next stage's input. Rejection
stops later challenge programs. `executeRoundsSampled` removes only the unit private state from the
ordered executor's result.

The honest-execution theorem transports one fixed polynomial relation through every selected
round. Its evaluation corollary additionally requires the interval to finish all variables. The
perfect-completeness theorem permits history-dependent challenge programs but assumes zero failure
probability for every round and public history; the measure and uniform theorems specialize that
assumption. These results do not establish arbitrary-round soundness, extraction, transcript
privacy, or independence for the general sampled challenges.
## Source logs and persistent world execution

`LoggedResult.sourceLog` and `LoggedRun.sourceLog` record answered source/access queries in order.
`Verifier.loggedLiftAccessImpl` lifts access interpretation and appends an entry after a source
query returns. Ambient queries remain in the open program and do not become source-log entries.
Earlier local source queries are routed into the final access signature; duplicates remain present.
The source log records verifier execution, not subsequent mathematical closing queries.

`executeLogged` pairs that log with the actual core result. Its erasure theorem is equality of open
programs, preserving order without assuming a commutative world. `executeWithRuntime` initializes
one persistent world and returns the logged run, final world state, and world-interface query log.
The source log and world log observe different interfaces. Neither a returned record nor a log
alone establishes generation; support or the runtime's `GeneratedBy` relation supplies provenance.

## Returned outcomes and missing mass

`Terminal Claim Fault` is the sum of acceptance carrying a claim, ordinary rejection, and an
explicit returned fault. Its `map` transforms accepted claims; `bind` continues only after
acceptance. The name refers to a returned protocol outcome, not a categorical terminal object.
`TerminalOutcome` specializes this sum to path-indexed open claims, while the earlier
`TerminalClaim` alias retains its separate optional-claim convention.

`TerminalRun.closed` interprets accepted claims using the recorded path and input behavior while
preserving rejection and the exact fault. `Terminal.ofOption` maps an absent optional claim to
rejection. In contrast, `decodeRuntime` assigns an absent runtime result a caller-selected fault.
These two meanings of absence are deliberately different.

`Terminal.observe` completes the successful-output measure and applies that explicit decoder.
Acceptance and rejection keep their original mass. The chosen fault receives its returned mass
plus missing execution mass, which may represent failure or nontermination. This is a measure
construction, not an executable recovery procedure or a fault-budget theorem.

## Concrete prefixes and available contexts

`ExecutionPrefix` pairs a structural cursor with exactly the concrete oracle messages already
sent. It is a concrete partial traversal carrying the same data as an `ExecutionPath` up to its cursor;
it need not admit a completion and does not prove support under a strategy. Its `Extends` witness retains public choices and hidden messages;
forgetting to `Cursor.Extends` retains only structural agreement.

`availableContext` names input oracles and oracle-send occurrences crossed before the cursor.
It does not allocate realizations. `contextInclusion` preserves those names under structural
extension, and `available_length_le` bounds an available occurrence by the stopping position.
Availability alone carries no strategy, probability, cryptographic promise, or runtime witness.

Prefix `comp` follows PolyFun cursor composition: first the left prefix, then its continuation.
It preserves concrete message order, and `plug` completes the prefix with a residual execution path.
These operations neither reorder effects nor select messages for unvisited branches.


## Phases, closing, and query profiles

`WorldSegments` partitions the ordered world-interface log by actual local actions.
`WorldPhase` labels each region with its party and concrete execution-prefix boundary, from
which `availableContext` derives the names available there. `contextInclusion` preserves these
names at the final boundary. Setup is a separate initial phase; repeated queries remain present.

`PhasedRun` retains the same execution's input behavior, concrete path, participant outputs,
source log, and world segments. Its optional `closed` and explicit-outcome `terminalClosed`
interpret accepted claims with that stored behavior and path. Rejection and exact returned faults
are preserved. The branch-indexed `closedResult` and `terminalClosedResult` expose this output
without losing its dependent branch type. Their executor equations agree with `executeCore`
and `executeTerminal` as open computations; they do not replay the verifier or substitute an
unrelated handler. Runtime execution additionally returns the persistent world's final state.

`queryProfile` counts world-interface queries under one supplied classification, and
`queryProfiles_sum` proves that the phase counts add to the whole log's count. The classifier is
not yet linked to `availableContext`; these equations establish neither permitted access nor a
cost bound. Handler-internal work is outside this surface log. Runtime `GeneratedBy` or support
hypotheses remain necessary when a theorem asserts that a record came from execution.

## Other interaction names

`RoleDecoration.toExplicitRoles` fills the implicit sender role at oracle nodes while retaining
the oracle tree. `toTypeTreeRoles` also projects to the ordinary type tree. The distinction is
between explicit role information and a change of tree representation.

`Verifier.liftAccessImpl` lifts pure access answers into the verifier's computation monad and
combines them with ambient queries. The plain reduction API uses `Tree` for its type-tree
parameter and `r₁.then r₂` for sequential composition. `Reduction.execute_then` describes execution
in that order. Node contexts such as `RoleContext` retain their names: these are indexed
assignments over nodes, following PolyFun's context convention.

## Migrating callers

Update source operations before replacing other identifiers. The old `tensor` and new `tensor`
have different query types, so a compatibility alias cannot preserve both meanings. Replace old
`tensor` uses by `sum` first, then old `parallel` uses by `tensor`. Keep upstream `PFunctor.tensor`
unchanged. For named contexts and their views, replace old `tensor` uses by `disjointUnion`.

For virtual oracles, rename old `mapSource` uses to `substSource` before renaming `rebase` to
`mapSource`. Apply the same substitutions to associated theorem names and explicit `Tree` named arguments
(previously `Context`) in the plain reduction API. The legacy `Reduction` API outside
`Interaction` is unchanged. File and import paths remain unchanged.

After migration, run `lake build` and `lake test`. The
[source examples](../../ArkLibTest/Interaction/Oracle/SourceExample.lean) distinguish query sums
from paired queries; the [context examples](../../ArkLibTest/Interaction/Oracle/ResourceExample.lean)
exercise disjointness, aliasing, dependent interpretation, and promise preservation.
